            <p>The documents of the district office were taken over by its successor, the District National Committee of Sedlčany. After its abolition, the material was handed over to the State District Archives in Příbram, where it was organized and inventoried in 1960-1964.</p>

            <p>The Sedlčany District Office was established in 1855. It had mixed political and judicial powers. In 1868, it was changed into the District Governor's Office. Its authority was limited to political issues. In 1868, the authority of the district governor's office was extended to the judicial districts of Votice and Sedlec, and so it remained until 1945. After the establishment of Czechoslovakia, the office was renamed the District Political Administration (in 1919) and the District Office (in 1928-1945). A drastic intervention in the district took place in the years 1943-1944, when the northern part of the district was occupied as a SS training ground. In 1945, the district office ceased to exist and its competence was taken over by its successor, the District National Committee of Sedlčany.</p>

            <p>The materials of the town of Příbram were taken over by the State District Archives of Příbram some time before 1997. The fonds is organized. However, it is chronologically divided into three separate sections, each having its own independent series of inventory numbers. These are the sections Municipal Office (MM) until 1790, Regulated Municipal Office (RM) 1790-1850, and Self-Government (S) 1850-1945.</p>

        <bioghist>
            <p>The first historical record of Příbram dates from 1216, when the Prague bishop Ondřej bought the farm Příbram from the Premonstratensian monastery in Teplá and began to build his estate around it. The first preserved records of the Jewish population date from the 16th century. Due to alleged mining frauds, Emperor Maximilian II issued a decree in 1568 prohibiting Jews from staying in the mining towns. The Jews began to return to the town in 1848. The Jewish religious community in Příbram was established in 1858.</p>
        </bioghist>

            <p>The older part of the materials of the district office in Příbram, namely books, general registry until 1874 and presidium files until 1918, was taken over by the Archives of the Ministry of the Interior after the establishment of Czechoslovakia and was organized there. The newer part remained in the registry office of the district office and was taken over by its successor, the district national committee. In 1960, the fonds was taken over by the State District Archives in Příbram. In 1962-1963, the fonds was organized and inventoried.</p>

            <p>The district governor's office in Příbram was established in 1850 for the judicial districts of Příbram and Dobříš. In 1855 it was changed into the district office with mixed political and judicial powers for the judicial district of Příbram. Dobříš was an independent district in 1855-1868. By order of the Ministry of the Interior, in 1868 the district office was again changed into the district governor's office with only political authority for the districts of Příbram and Dobříš. After the establishment of Czechoslovakia, the office was renamed the District Political Administration in 1919, and the District Office in 1928-1945. By a decree of the Minister of the Interior of 1937, a branch office of the district office with its seat in Dobříš was established for the Dobříš judicial district and part of the competence of the district office was transferred to it. In 1942, it was abolished again, and its agenda was taken over again by the district office. In May 1945, a national committee was established, later transformed into the Příbram District National Committee which became the successor of the abolished district office.</p>
