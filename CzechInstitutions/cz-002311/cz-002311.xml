            <p>The documents were stored in the past with the mayor of the municipality. In the 20th century, the municipal registry was often relocated, because of which the older file material was destroyed. Parchments, documents, a collection of photographs, and posters were stored in the Uherské Brod Museum, and part of the archive was probably in Luhačovice Castle which was engulfed in fire in 1917. The preserved archive material was transferred to the State District Archives of Gottwaldov (today Zlín) in 1960 and 1964. The fonds was inventoried in 1967.</p>
        </custodhist>
        <bioghist>
            <p>The oldest record of Luhačovice dates from 1412. In 1629 the manor was bought by Gabriel Serenyi, whose family possessed it until 1945. Luhačovice was promoted to a town on June 3, 1936. The first-instance political supervision of the town was exercised until 1949 by the district governor's office of Uherský Brod, where the judicial district was also located. In the second half of the 19th century, Jews began to buy land in the municipality starting business there. In the following generations, they expanded their business to the surrounding area. An example is the Jelínek family, the distillery owners in Vizovice. Jewish business families owned several famous spa hotels and villas and the Slavia café. Many local non-Jewish entrepreneurs also adapted their business to the demands of Jewish visitors to the spa as far as housing, food, entertainment, and spiritual life were concerned.</p>

        <scopecontent>
            <p>The fonds contains documents of the municipality of Luhačovice, official books, files, and accounting material. Jews began to settle in Luhačovice permanently after 1848, until then they visited Luhačovice only during the spa season. Information on Jews can be found in the Luhačovice Archive fonds in individual documents: permission for Jews to use a hall for services 1845; Jewish religious community: model statutes, a request for the establishment of a prayer house 1934; the building commission for the construction of the synagogue and hospital 1928. From the Holocaust period: a list of Jews in Luhačovice, their accommodation, medical certificates, restrictions on movement, removal, administration of confiscated property 1939–1944. Specific attention should be paid to the following material: building documents and plans 1862–1944; concessions: restaurants, inns, hotels 1905–1945; trade licenses, businesses 1932.</p>

            <p>The large fires that repeatedly affected Napajedla resulted in the destruction of several files from the older period. The files were stored in offices and at the town hall. In the 1950s, all documents were moved to two rooms in the archives of the Local National Committee in Napajedla and some were in the Regional Museum. In 1960, the Napajedla Municipal Archives became a temporary depository of them. The material was moved in 1968 to the Gottwaldov District Archives (now Zlín). Here it was inventoried and supplemented with materials obtained by further delimitations and arranged.</p>
        </custodhist>
        <bioghist>
            <p>The first record of Napajedla dates from 1355. The owners of the Napajedla estate were the Žerotín family, followed by the Rotal family, and in the 19th century by the Stockau family. A district court was established in Napajedla (1850–1949) and in 1855–1868 a mixed district office combining the functions of judicial and political administration. For most of the time, however, the district office was seated in other towns, in 1850–1855 in Holešov and in 1868–1949 in Uherské Hradiště. In 1898, Napajedla was promoted to a town by the Emperor. Jews only began to settle in the town after 1848. They moved there from larger Jewish communities in the surrounding area. The local community fell under the administration of the Jewish community in Uherský Ostroh. It ran a prayer house where a school for Jewish children was based, too.</p>
        </bioghist>
        <scopecontent>
            <p>The fonds contains documents of the municipality of Napajedla, official books, files, and accounting material. The first records of Jews in Napajedla are mainly associated with the distillery. The distillery was managed by Jewish tenants for most of the 19th century. Information on Jews can be found in the fonds only in some documents from the Holocaust period: confiscated Jewish property - forced administration, rental of real estate, local ordinances and regulations concerning Jews and their property 1939–1945; internment of Napajedla citizens in concentration and prisoner of war camps, death certificates of interned persons 1939–1944. Sufficient attention should be paid to the following material: domicile registers 1870–1947; list of homeowners in Napajedla 1894; registries of foreign citizens living in Napajedla 1885–1940; books of the dead 1866–1943; domicile right -applications, grants, rejections 1851–1944; inn and tapping concessions 1879–1944. These documents should also be confronted with materials stored in the Napajedla Municipal National Committee fonds, NAD 671 (see Jewish property - estates, national administration 1945–1949; declarations of deaths of people killed in concentration camps and Nazi prisons 1945–1948).</p>

            <p>Valuable documents of the town council were stored in the municipal chest at the town hall, the form of storing other written agendas being unknown. In 1954, the district archives were established in Valašské Klobouky, where the documents of the town hall were handed over. The archives, together with the oldest archive material stored in the museum in Valašské Klobouky, was then transferred in 1963 to the branch of the district archives in Gottwaldov (now Zlín), where it was inventoried. In the years 1968–1969, the fonds was organized.</p>
        </custodhist>
        <bioghist>
            <p>Valašské Klobouky was first mentioned in a document from 1341. The town's representatives were initially headed by the Vogt, who was eventually degraded to the position of an executor of the power of the council, and the main representatives of the town became mayor and councilors. After the revolution in 1848–1849, a district court was established in Valašské Klobouce (1850–1949), and in 1855–1868 a mixed district office combining the functions of judicial and political administration. For most of the time, however, the seat of the district office was Uherský Brod (1850–1855, 1868–1949).</p>

            <p>The first records of the Jewish population in Valašské Klobouky date back to the 16th century. The Jews ran commercial and hospitality businesses, and engaged in dyeing and making draperies which was a strategic craft of that region. Because the Jewish descent made social advancement difficult, there were cases of conversion to Christianity - this was the case of the originally Jewish family of the Bratmanns, whose converted member later even became mayor of Valašské Klobouky. The number of Jews in the town did not exceed several dozens of individuals in the second half of the 19th century. In connection with the decline of handicraft cloth production, there was also a gradual outflow of Jews from the city. The fonds contains documents of the town self-government, deeds, official books, and files. Jews are specifically mentioned in documents from the Holocaust period: register of Jews, instructions (1939–1943). Sufficient attention should be paid to the following material: guild and trade issues 1779-1845; trade matters - ordinances, price lists, apprenticeship certificates 1855–1943; parcel protocols, 1878–1945; applications for domicile 1852–1939; enlistments, ordinances, billing 1881–1939; building permits 1852–1945.</p>

            <p>The town council documents were stored at the town hall. Most of these documents burned in the fire of 1887, only some were saved. They were later bought by the Moravian Provincial Archives in Brno, from where they were transferred to the fonds of the town of Vizovice in 1969.

            <p>The town of Vizovice was first mentioned in a document dating back to 1261. In 1570, Vizovice was promoted to a town. Since 1850 it belonged to the district governor's office in Uherský Brod. A district court, a gendarmerie station and a notary's office were established in Vizovice, and from 1855 the so-called mixed district office. In 1868, Vizovice was included in the district governor's office in Holešov, and the court district remained in Vizovice. In 1935, a new political district of Zlín was formed from the judicial districts of Vizovice and Zlín. The first records of Jews in Vizovice are associated with the manorial distillery from the 17th century. Jews engaged in distillery business in Vizovice and its surroundings also in the 19th century; after 1848, their number expanded. The local Jewish association of Zion operated there. In 1902, a synagogue was built. After the establishment of Czechoslovakia, a branch of the Jewish Party was established in Vizovice.</p>

            <p>The documents were always stored at the town hall. After the fire of the Zlín City Hall in 1922, the registry was handed over as a deposit to the archives of the National Museum in Prague. The material was taken to the district archives in Gottwaldov (today Zlín) in the years 1968–1971. The fonds was gradually consolidated and processed in 1971–1975. An addendum to it was organized and an inventory was made in 2002.</p>
        </custodhist>
        <bioghist>
            <p>The earliest record of Zlín comes from a document from 1322. Since the 15th century, the town council and mayor have been at the head of the town. The representative of the lords in the city was the Voigt. After 1848, the municipal board was at the head of the municipality which elected the executive and administrative body - the municipal board (1935–1949). The Jews only started to settle permanently in Zlín after 1848, mostly coming from Jewish communities in Holešov and Uherský Brod. The prayer room was in one of the burgher houses in the square. However, Jews from all over Czechoslovakia also moved there to work in Baťa's factories. In the 1930s, more than a hundred Jewish people were permanently settled in Zlín, or at least they stayed there for some time. A room in the Zlín chateau was used as a prayer room. In 1935, a special Jewish department was established in the newly built Forest Cemetery.</p>

        <scopecontent>
            <p>The fonds contains the material of the self-government of the city of Zlín such as documents, official books, file material and accounting material. Information on Jews can be found in the following documents: objections to Jews settling in Zlín, 1848. From the Holocaust period these documents are the following ones: Jewish property, forced administration, purchase of Jewish land 1939–1945. Sufficient attention should also be paid to the following documents: register of members of the municipality of Zlín 1891–1948; list of members of the city of Zlín 1901–1947; register of the dead 1910–1939; trade matters: confectionery businesses, inn concessions, trade establishments; criminal files of the Zlín Police Office (Dezidér Ornstein) 1924–1948.</p>

            <p>The documents were stored in the premises of the municipal self-government. Selected materials remained stored in the city registry until 1961. The first inventory was compiled in 1963. Later, the fonds was supplemented by additions and the inventory modified.</p>

            <p>The oldest record of Slavičín dates from 1256. The patrimonial administration of the municipality was performed by the holder of the Slavičín manor until 1849. After the reforms of 1848–1849, the district governor's office in Uherský Brod (1850–1855, 1868–1949) and the mixed district office in Valašské Klobouky (1855–1868) exercised the first-instance supervision over the municipality. In terms of jurisdiction, in 1850–1923 the town belonged to the district of the Valašské Klobouky judicial district, and in 1923–1949 to the Bojkovice judicial district. Slavičín gained the status of a town in 1964.</p>

            <p>The permanent settlement of Jews (the Zimlich family) in the village began as early as the end of the 18th century and was connected with the operation of shops and later also the operation of pubs. Gradually, the number of people of Jewish descent grew to several tens. With the occupation of the Czech lands by the Nazi Germany, the Jews were persecuted. In Slavičín, among other things, they had to perform forced work on the construction of a German training shooting range at Blyštický potok, where they were taken daily. After their internment in Uherský Brod, forced administration was imposed on their property. The transports were taken to concentration and extermination camps, from where only a few returned. The fonds of the Archives of the Town of Slavičín contains documents of the municipality self-government, deeds, official books, file material, and accounting material. Jews are explicitly mentioned in documents from the Holocaust period: Jewish affairs - a report by the Jewish religious community in Uherský Brod on the possibility of Jewish movement and compulsory reporting of residence, forced administration of Jewish property of Cyrill Berger and Malvine Bergerová in Slavičín (administrator Dr. Schulze, Brno), 1941. Sufficient attention should be paid to the following material: List of issued residence certificates, 1912–1941; home affiliation: applications for and loss of home affiliation 1881–1944; marital separation 1937–1940; protocols on the inspection of the dead: Slavičín, Hrádek, Vrbětice 1896–1925; construction matters: construction files and plans for the construction of residential houses and farm buildings (nos. 4–243 and without nos.), statement of constructions and complaints about offenses against the building regulations 1880–1944.</p>

            <p>In the past, municipal documents were processed at the town hall, but there are no detailed reports on the form of their storing. After the transfer of the archival material (together with other non-appraised material) to the district archives in Gottwaldov (today Zlín) in 1959, the first inventory was made. The fonds was later completed and inventoried in 1994.</p>

        <bioghist>
            <p>The earliest record of Slušovice dates from 1261. From 1373, Slušovice belonged to the Lukov manor. In 1466, Slušovice was promoted to a market town. The municipality was originally headed by the Voigt, who represented the nobility. His position in the municipality gradually weakened at the expense of the town self-government (mayor and councilors). In the years 1850–1949, the district court in Vizovice exercised the first-instance jurisdiction over Slušovice. In 1850–1855, political supervision was exercised by the Uherský Brod district governor's office, in 1855–1868 by the Valašské Klobouky mixed district office, in 1868–1935 by the Holešov district office, and in 1935–1949 by the newly created Zlín district office.</p>
        </bioghist>
        <scopecontent>
            <p>At the end of the 18th century, Jewish businessman Marek Knöpfelmacher from Holešov gained a lease of a distillery yard with land and meadows from the nobility (emphyteusis). In the coming generations, several other Jewish entrepreneurs took turns on this property. Individuals of the Jewish faith began to settle in Slušovice after 1848 from the surrounding communities (Holešov, Bystřice pod Hostýnem, Vrbětice). In 1885, 7 Jewish families were registered in Slušovice. The fonds contains documents of the municipality of Slušovice, deeds, official books, files, and accounting material. Information on Jews can be found in documents from the Holocaust period: forced administration of Jewish property (Winterstein, Hamlisch) 1941–1942. However, sufficient attention should also be paid to the following material: domicile affairs and home affiliation, certificates of clean criminal register, certificates of property and earnings 1877–1941; register of members of the municipality 1890–1950; register of foreign families and books for foreigners reporting their staying 1912–1946; cadaster of buildings and their owners or users 1920–1952; trade concessions 1929–1935.</p>

            <p>The documents were stored in the registries of individual company departments. In the post-war years, other important documents kept from raids in the country were gradually stored in the newly established offices of the Svit company. The Svit Company Archives was established in 1960. In September 2012, the fonds of Baťa, a. s., Zlín was handed over to the Zlín State District Archives.</p>

            <p>In 1908, Tomáš Baťa became the sole owner of a footwear company. The First World War marked a transition from a local small-scale production to the future worldwide company. A foreign network of company stores began to develop in the early 1920s. The World War II provided an economic potential. New markets opened for the company due to its connection with the Third Reich and the older markets were then filled with new programs. At the same time, the connection of the company to the Nazi Germany remained sufficiently flexible, so that at the time of the Germany defeat, the company easily broke away from its economic and social structures. After the end of the war, a temporary administration was appointed to head the company, and on October 27, 1945, the company was nationalized.</p>

            <p>Documents concerning the administration of the institute, staff matters, balance sheets, technical plans and reports, statistical records, as well as part of more general records of medical and other health activities were in the registry of the Baťa Comp. and its successor Svit. in 2012, the fonds of the Baťa Hospital in Zlín was handed over to the State District Archive in Zlín, where it is stored and made accessible.</p>
        </custodhist>
        <bioghist>
            <p>The Baťa Hospital was established in 1927 at the initiative and expenses of the Baťa Comp. due to the needs of the company's employees. It was a company hospital managed by a specially elected hospital committee. The actual construction began in 1927. At the beginning, the hospital had three specialized departments. In 1932, it already had 11 buildings. After the Second World War, the Baťa Hospital was transformed into a hospital of the national company Baťa Zlín, later the national company Svit Gottwaldov. In 1949, the hospital was transformed into the State Regional Hospital.</p>
        </bioghist>
        <scopecontent>
            <p>A large part of the Baťa hospital staff consisted of Jewish doctors, of whom more than two dozen worked at the hospital at the end of the 1930s. Some of them left Baťa's hospital to set up private surgeries or went to another hospital. However, most of them left the Baťa Hospital because of anti-Jewish measures introduced by the after-Munich Czechoslovakia. The fonds contains documents on the hospital operation, personnel matters, and accounting material. Information on Jews can be found a document recapitulating the result of anti-Jewish measures from 1939: Report on the departure of 23 Jewish doctors from Zlín 1937–1939. Sufficient attention should also be paid to the following material: death registers 1927–1937; death reports 1938–1945; operation books: the obstetrics department of MUDr. Král, 1939–1940; coroner's reports 1939. Documents about Jewish doctors should be confronted with the preserved files of Jewish doctors employed at Baťa Hospital in Zlín in the 1930s, which are stored in the same archive, in the fonds Baťa, a. s, Zlín NAD 1921.</p>

            <p>The documents of the district office were inappropriately stored in various cellars and attics of Zlín buildings such as the town hall, the chateau, and the Study Institute, and in the post-war years also in Uherské Hradiště, Štípa and Bojkovice. Improper storage has damaged and destroyed many materials. The fonds was inventoried in 1975. In 2012, it was administratively divided according to chronological criteria into separate fonds of the Zlín District Office I and the Zlín District National Committee.</p>
        </custodhist>
        <bioghist>
            <p>The District Office in Zlín was established in 1935. A district governor was appointed head, who chaired the advisory boards - the district council and its adjacent body - the district committee. During the Nazi occupation (1939–1945), Zlín was the seat of the Oberlandrat (1939–1942), and the district office was subject to its control. In 1942, the so-called Reichsauftragsverwaltung were established. They took over an important part of the security-administrative agenda from the district authorities.</p>
        </bioghist>
        <scopecontent>
            <p>The fonds contains documents of public administration, official books, files, accounting material and associated agenda. Jews are mentioned in the presidium files of the Zlín District Office, these often being measures, circulars, instructions and orders of higher instances such as: an investigation into anti-Jewish leaflets distributed in the Zlín region in 1936 and 1938; trips of retired German officers of the Jewish faith to the Czechoslovak Republic; measures in the district of Zlín in 1937; the number of Jewish refugees moving into the district of the Zlín political district in 1937; measures against the influx of emigrants from Romania - a warning against a Romanian Jew, Mikuláš Solomon, in 1938; information on the dismissal of Jewish employees in companies in the Czechoslovak Republic controlled by the German capital from 1938; the danger of the so-called "Jewish" invasion of Czechoslovakia due to the persecution of Jews in Germany on Crystal Night 1938; compilation of lists of civil servants of Jewish origin 1939.From the period of Nazi occupation and the Holocaust, there are presidium files including the following: an instruction of Generalkommando XVII-Ic on the issuance of passports to Jews emigrating to Britain, 1939; a ban on filling vacancies in the city and town councils after Jews in 1939; requesting an overview of Jewish property, including farms, by the Oberlandrat in Zlín on 18 and 22 April 1939; property situation and personal data of private German teacher Otto Beck 1939; a ban on carrying hunting weapons for Jews 1939; issues of banning ritual slaughter of animals 1939; lists of the education staff living in marriage to Jews 1940; confiscating Jewish property: statements by employees about their Aryan origins and the origin of their family members 1940; removal of Jewish companies, designation of Jewish warehouses, shops and businesses 1939–1941; confiscation of books by Jewish authors 1941; adjustment of shopping hours for Jews, attendance of Jewish children in schools 1941; removal of inscriptions and drawings of anti-German character by organized Jewish groups: lists of Jews included in the groups from Malenovice, Vizovice and Otrokovice 1941; a request for a list of public employees designated as Jews and mixed races or living in mixed marriage with a Jew in 1941; an investigation into the ancestry of employees and their wives: lists, statements 1941. The remaining files of the Zlín District Office I contain materials from the period of the Second Republic and the Nazi occupation, these being complete files of information on the introduced restrictive measured: the legal status of Jews in public life, the ancestry of Jews 1939-1944; records of the assessment of Jews 1939; records of Jews and Jewish property 1939–1942; Jews and mixed races: a survey of nationality 1939–1940; records of foreigners: residence permit, deportations, reports of Jewish residence 1941–1943. A part of the fonds: The Zlín Administration, on behalf of the Reich (Reichsauftragsverwaltung), keeps particularly valuable daily and weekly reports of individual gendarmerie stations and the District Gendarmerie Headquarters in Zlín for the years 1942–1945. Jews are explicitly mentioned individually: the discovery of the corpse of Terezia Friemlová, a half-Jew, who committed suicide in her apartment in Kyjov on January 8, 1945.</p>

            <p>The municipal documents were stored at the town hall in earlier times. Parts of the documents were destroyed in fires. The first appraisal was probably carried out in 1955 by an archivist. Other additions to the fonds date from 1958, 1965, 1970 and 1971. The fonds was processed and an inventory made in 1978. The archive material of the town of Malenovice and the local national committee was organized into one fonds mainly because the minutes of the meetings of the council and the board and the financial commission continued to be made without interruption even after 1945, and also because the local national committee was active for only three years.</p>

            <p>The earliest record of Malenovice dates from 1321. It was promoted to a market town in the 1460s. The last owner of the Malenovice estate and the castle was the Šternberk family (1804–1945), which also performed patrimonial administration of the town until 1849. After the reforms of 1848–1849, the district governor's office in Holešov (1850–1855), the mixed district office of Napajedla (1855–1868), and the political district of Uherské Hradiště (1868–1935), performed first-instance supervision over the municipality. From 1935, it was part of the newly established political district of Zlín. Since 1 January 1949, Malenovice became part of the newly established town of Gottwald called Gottwaldov VIII -Malenovice.</p>
