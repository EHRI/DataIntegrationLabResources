            <p>In the past, municipal documents were processed at the town hall, but there are no detailed reports on the form of their storing. After the transfer of the archival material (together with other non-appraised material) to the district archives in Gottwaldov (today Zlín) in 1959, the first inventory was made. The fonds was later completed and inventoried in 1994.</p>

        <bioghist>
            <p>The earliest record of Slušovice dates from 1261. From 1373, Slušovice belonged to the Lukov manor. In 1466, Slušovice was promoted to a market town. The municipality was originally headed by the Voigt, who represented the nobility. His position in the municipality gradually weakened at the expense of the town self-government (mayor and councilors). In the years 1850–1949, the district court in Vizovice exercised the first-instance jurisdiction over Slušovice. In 1850–1855, political supervision was exercised by the Uherský Brod district governor's office, in 1855–1868 by the Valašské Klobouky mixed district office, in 1868–1935 by the Holešov district office, and in 1935–1949 by the newly created Zlín district office.</p>

            <p>At the end of the 18th century, Jewish businessman Marek Knöpfelmacher from Holešov gained a lease of a distillery yard with land and meadows from the nobility (emphyteusis). In the coming generations, several other Jewish entrepreneurs took turns on this property. Individuals of the Jewish faith began to settle in Slušovice after 1848 from the surrounding communities (Holešov, Bystřice pod Hostýnem, Vrbětice). In 1885, 7 Jewish families were registered in Slušovice. The fonds contains documents of the municipality of Slušovice, deeds, official books, files, and accounting material. Information on Jews can be found in documents from the Holocaust period: forced administration of Jewish property (Winterstein, Hamlisch) 1941–1942. However, sufficient attention should also be paid to the following material: domicile affairs and home affiliation, certificates of clean criminal register, certificates of property and earnings 1877–1941; register of members of the municipality 1890–1950; register of foreign families and books for foreigners reporting their staying 1912–1946; cadaster of buildings and their owners or users 1920–1952; trade concessions 1929–1935.</p>
        </scopecontent>
        <arrangement>
            <p>The fonds is divided as follows: I. Deeds; II. Official books; III. File material; IV. Accounting material; V. Other material.</p>
