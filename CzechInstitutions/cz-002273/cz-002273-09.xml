            <p>The registry of the mixed district office underwent a drastic appraisal proceeding, either in the registry office of the district office or in some archives where it had been stored since the 1940s. The registry from 1905–1943 was almost completely transferred to the Počátky District Archives, from where it was transferred to the Pelhřimov District Archives after the merger.</p>

            <p>The mixed district office of Kamenice nad Lipou began operating on May 26, 1855 as a joint office of the first instance for political and judicial administration. These offices were abolished on 31 August 1868. In the years 1868–1905, there was no office at the district level in Kamenice nad Lipou. The district was administered by the Pelhřimov District Governor's Office. The independent District Governor's Office of Kamenice nad Lipou was established on April 1, 1905. In 1919, it was renamed the District Political Administration, and on December 1, 1928, the self-government was taken over by the state administration and merged with the political office in the Kamenice nad Lipou District Office. On 1 June 1942, the independent district office was abolished and annexed to the Pelhřimov District Office as a branch, which was definitively abolished on 30 September 1943. In 1945, it was replaced by the Kamenice nad Lipou District National Committee.</p>
