        <custodhist>
            <p>The fonds is not inventoried, so its history is unknown. From the court's registry, the documents were handed over to the Pelhřimov People's Court and, after the merger in 1960, to the newly established Pelhřimov District Court, from which the documents are handed over directly to the District Archives.</p>
        </custodhist>
        <bioghist>
            <p>After the abolition of the manorial administration and with the establishment of a new organization of political and judicial administration, the Pelhřimov District Court was established in 1850 for the judicial district of the same name, which respected the territory of the existing manors within their borders. In the period from 26 May 1855 to 31 August 1868, the performance of political and judicial administration was merged into one office, the so-called mixed district office. The separation of political and judicial administration took place again in 1868, when a district court was established, which existed until 1949.</p>
        </bioghist>
        <scopecontent>
            <p>The fonds contains an agenda arising from the activities of the district court. The agenda is divided according to individual periods into sections A, B, C, and D - land books. The processed part of the fonds contains a death register (1851-1855), a list of wills (1857-1868), and inheritance protocols (1855-1897), where information on Jews from the district could be found. The unprocessed part of the fonds contains inheritance proceedings, including the Jewish population - from older periods only selectively after appraisal proceedings. The files of call number D (inheritance) from 1933-1948 and call numbers P (guardianship) from 1902-1948 have been completely preserved. The files can be searched on the basis of name lists D (1941-1954), registers D (1910, 1929-1930, 1948-1949), registers P (1898-1950), and files P (1914-1949). The files of individual deceased persons contain biographical information about the person, their relatives, property, and dealing with the inheritance.</p>
