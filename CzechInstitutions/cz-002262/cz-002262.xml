            <p>The town archive was always kept in the town hall. Documents from the oldest period have not been preserved. The older part of the fonds has been preserved only in fragments. The files of the political department of the municipal office from 1826 to 1850 have been almost completely preserved. The fonds was gradually transferred to the central depository of the Nymburk district archives in Lysá nad Labem in the late 1980s. It was definitively organized and inventoried in 1995-2002. The fonds is equipped with an inventory.</p>

        <bioghist>
            <p>The first record of Poděbrady dates back from 1223. Since the 16th century reports of self-government have been preserved. The administrative body was the town council consisting of 12 councilors who elected the mayor. Since 1850, there had been the municipal committee, which elected the municipal board headed by the mayor, and this municipal establishment lasted until 1919. In September 1940, the town council and the council board council were dissolved, and the town administrative commission was established. In January 1942, a German government commissioner was appointed to Poděbrady. After the war, a local national committee was established.</p>

            <p>The most important part of the fonds is presidium files, which have been preserved except for the year of 1864. The documents were stored at the seat of the office, and after its abolition they were transferred to Nymburk. The fonds was deposited in Prague and Jičín, until being transferred to the District Archives Nymburk in the late 1950s. In 1972 - 1974, presidium files from 1851-1942 were processed in the form of thematic catalogs. Since 2006, the fonds has been gradually processed.</p>

            <p>The office began its activities in 1850 as a district governor's office, a body of political administration of first instance. It was subject to the regional administration in Jičín. In 1855, the mixed political-judicial district offices began to operate, being separated in 1868. In that year, the District Governor's Office in Poděbrady was re-established. In 1928, the name was changed to the District Office and the branch of the district political administration in Nymburk was merged with the political administration in Poděbrady. The office was abolished in 1942 and the agenda was transferred to the district office in Nymburk.</p>
