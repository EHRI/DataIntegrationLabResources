        <custodhist>
            <p>The files were stored in the registry according to the then valid file rules and plan. The materials of the fonds were handed over to the Archives of the Czech Lands in 1940, and in the post-war period to the State Archives in Prague. The fonds was partially inventoried in the 1960s and gradually transferred to the District Archives in Kladno. The fonds was organized there, and a new partial inventory was made for it in 2016. The fonds also includes the land agendas of the Unhošť and Kladno district offices, which are older than the fonds itself.</p>

        <bioghist>
            <p>The Kladno District Court was established in 1877, being separated from the Unhošť District Court. It was subordinated to the District Governor's Office in Smíchov and since 1893 to the newly established Governor's Office in Kladno. The agenda originally included mainly civil affairs and less serious criminal cases. Later, a criminal court for juveniles (1931), a labor court (1934-44), and an arbitral tribunal, were established. The judiciary in Czechoslovakia began to function in a completely different way after the Communist coup in 1948.</p>

        <scopecontent>
            <p>The fonds contains documents originated from the activities of the district court, file material, and the agenda of land registers. Information on Jews can be found especially in inheritance files, where it is possible to search by names of persons. Declarations of death from the war period are also relevant - one can find information on Lidice citizens and Jewish citizens taken into concentration camps. The subsequent inheritance agenda dealing with the inheritance of these murdered citizens is relevant, too. The files can also be found in the handling period of 1924-48, those concerning Jews until 1960. In the handling period of 1924–1948, it is necessary to point out the year 1942, where there is a record of the supply of yellow Jewish stars for prisoners of Jewish origin (Pres 37/16/1942). Probate matters (IV, A, D) are the most extensive and comprehensively preserved agenda in the fonds. The files reflect the property relations of individual families in the district and property transfers within families. They are also evidence of the impact of the First and Second World Wars on the population. These files were widely used in connection with restitutions. At the same time, they are a great source of information not only for authorities, but also for amateur genealogists dealing with their family trees. Declarations of death and proof of death (M) gained importance after World War II, especially in 1949–1950, when the case of murdered citizens of Lidice, including children, was discussed. In most cases, these matters were handled by the Society for the Reconstruction of Lidice and Ležáky on behalf of the survivors (inv. no. 538, boxes no. 1033 and 1034). Procedures for the redemption of instruments (Um) can only be found in the post-war period. There are procedures for the redemption of deposits of persons lost during the war (inv. no. 528, boxes no. 728 and inv. no. 539, box no. 1035).</p>
