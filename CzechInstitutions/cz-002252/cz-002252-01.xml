        <custodhist>
            <p>The fonds originated from the activities of the mayor and the council (12 councilors) of this non-royal town, and after 1850 from the activities of the municipal council and the board. The fonds was stored in the town hall building, where it suffered considerable damage, especially during the war. Later, a part of the fonds was discarded by the Municipal National Committee. In 1956, it was handed over to the district and town archives in Slaný. The fonds was organized, and in 1972, an inventory was made for it.</p>

        <bioghist>
            <p>The municipality was promoted to a town in 1510 and was renamed Muncifaj. In 1882, the town council asked to change the name of the town back to Smečno. The town had been owned by the Martinic, later Clam-Martinic, family since the 16th century. After 1850, the town of Smečno was part of the political, judicial and tax district of Slaný, Prague Region. Since 1849, elected representatives had stood at the head of the municipality.</p>
