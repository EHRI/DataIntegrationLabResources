            <p>The office's registry files were kept in the office building. Registries from the former District Political Administration in Smíchov, Karlín and Zbraslav were also transferred there. In the 1920s, part of the office was handed over to the Archives of the Capital City of Prague. The registry of the Smíchov and Karlín District Councils was almost completely destroyed. Part of the documentation was destroyed, and part was taken over in 1960 by the District Archives of Praha-východ, and later the District Archives of Praha-západ. In 1963, the documents of the so-called economic department were added to the fonds. The fonds was organized in 1959-1961. An inventory was made in 1963.</p>

In 1928, the name was changed to the District Office of Praha-venkov. It was headed by the district governor. The office was abolished in 1942, and its territory was divided into two new administrative units, Praha-venkov-jih and Praha-venkov-sever.</p>

            <p>The fonds originated from activities of the District National Committee of Jílové and Praha-východ in 1945-60. Most of the files were concentrated in the office registry, from where a part was transferred in 1952 to the district archives. After the abolition of the office in 1960, the written material of the District National Committee of Jílové was moved to the loft, where it was considerably damaged and part of it was lost. Subsequently, another part of the documents was transferred to the district archives. The remainder was moved there in 1970-73. The material was arranged and an inventory was created to it.</p>

            <p>The fonds was transferred to the Praha-jih District Archives in 1954, and in 1960 it was stored in the Praha-západ District Archives. The material was transported in good condition. It was arranged and in 1963 an inventory was prepared to it.</p>

            <p>The Praha-venkov-jih District Office began to operate in 1942 on the territory of the abolished Praha-venkov District Office (Zbraslav, Jílové and Říčany judicial districts). It was headed by a German governor, who was also the head of the Reichsauftragverwaltung. It was abolished in 1945 and replaced by a national committee, from which the districts of Jílové and Říčany were separated. During the Nazi occupation, three municipalities - Hostěradice, Hradištko and Pikovice - were forcibly displaced and a military training camp of the occupiers was established on their territory. In 1943, it was changed to the Hradištko concentration camp. About 500 political prisoners of various nationalities were imprisoned there, and many of them perished.</p>
