            <p>The fonds was probably always kept at the town hall. In 1960, the Kaňk Town Archives became part of the District Archives in Kutná Hora. In 1982, a group inventory was developed. The fonds was organized and an inventory made in 2012 - 2013.</p>
        </custodhist>
        <bioghist>
            <p>The first record appeared in a deed from 1369. Municipal affairs were administered by several councilors headed by the mayor, who were appointed by the Kutná Hora town council. The period 1848 - 1850 was a time of transition towards the municipal self-government. In the self-governing period, Kaňk was an independent local municipality until the Nazi occupation. The reorganization of the town administration, especially the establishment of a system of representation based on political parties, took place after the municipal elections in 1919. From 1939, the village was administered by a government commissioner. Kaňk became a part of Kutná Hora in 1950.</p>

            <p>The fonds was transferred to the archives from the District National Committee building, where the documents had been stored. In 1964 - 1965, the material was arranged and an inventory list was made for it, the additions being made in 1972. In 1967 - 1972, catalogs of the presidium files from 1850-1945 were made. The fonds contains administrative and registration books from the years of (1794) 1850-1945 (1957) and presidium files from the years of 1850 -1945. The common registry included in the handling periods has been fully preserved from the period after 1900 (until 1900 only fragments have been preserved).

        <bioghist>
            <p>The district office was in operation in the years of 1850 - 1945. In 1850, the district governor's office was established in Kutná Hora with jurisdiction over the Kutná Hora and Čáslav judicial districts. From 1855 to 1868, there was the so-called mixed district office (judicial and political administration) there, the administration being carried out in that period only in the judicial district of Kutná Hora. In 1868, the Uhlířské Janovice judicial district was added to it. After 1868, the district governor's office was restored, and the judiciary was separated from the administration. In 1919, the district governor's office was renamed the district political administration. In 1927, the name was again changed to the district office. Its activities ended with the establishment of the District National Committee.</p>
