"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion â€“ or Protocols of the Wise Men of Zion - is an anti-Semitic forgery, detailing in 24 chapters the ""Jewish plan"" to take over the world. The fake document is a compilation from various sources, issued in Russia by Sergei Nilus in 1905, and since then, published in various languages around the globe. The collection includes documents on the origins and the development of the myth."
