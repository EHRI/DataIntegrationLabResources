                    <p>The central concept of the research project is «social void», a phenomenon that was characteristic of Central and Eastern Europe during and immediately after World War II as a result of mass ethnic cleansing, political revolutions, forced displacement and migration. The project focuses both on the material dimension of post-war social change (e.g. acquisition of property) and the subjective sphere of social practices and relationships. His goal was to examine the processes of replacing the missing elements of social life with local communities of Poland and Ukraine. The interviews conducted as part of the project show how the void was filled after the social groups (e.g. landowners, wealthy peasants), representatives of ethnic communities (Jews, Poles, Ukrainians) and professional groups (e.g. shoemakers, pharmacists, doctors, or more broadly – craftsmen, intelligence) were evicted by the war and post-war changes. The analysis concerns changes in the ownership structure, economic dysfunction, transformations of social and cultural practices, as well as changes in relations and social norms. The conversations archived at the Center were recorded in a dozen of locations in Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk and Ternopil regions by an interdisciplinary team of Polish-Ukrainian researchers. The research was carried out in small towns and villages, combining the methodology of microhistory and biographic interview as part of oral history. In total, almost 150 interviews were collected in Ukraine, of which 40 are currently available in UStories collection. The conversations recorded in Poland as part of this bilateral study are preserved in Warsaw at Archiwum Historii Mówionej. The project coordinator is Anna Wylegała, a researcher at the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Project is financed by the National Humanities Development Program, registration number 12H 13 0584 82. Galyna Bodnar worked with the materials before their publication.</p>

                        <p>An interview with a native resident of the village Rydvanivka, Rohatyn district in Ivano-Frankivsk oblast who comes from a Polish-Ukrainian family. The relatives of his mother, Polish by nationality, and father, Ukrainian, didn’t approve of the interethnic marriage. The man lost his parents as a child and was brought up by his sister. He was arrested in 1947 and returned to Rohatyn in 1954 after serving his sentence. The conversation abounds with details, names of peers and fellow villagers. The narrator tells in detail about the pre-war life of the village, rural life, aggravation of the Polish-Ukrainian opposition and forced eviction of the Poles to Poland, the restoration of the Soviet power in the post-war years and the opposition of the Ukrainian nationalist underground, help the locals provided to the rebels, Ukrainians relocated from Poland. The interviewee gives some great examples to illustrate the aggravation of the interpersonal relationships, the moments of personal choice, the unfairness of death, violence, as well as paint the portraits of the Soviet governor, a military man and a member of the Ukrainian underground. A separate conversation thread is the memories of the Holocaust of Jews in Rohatyn. The man recalled the Jewish quarter in the town, the creation and location of a ghetto, hidings, the location and the process of firing squads, the fate of the Jewish property.<br />
Recorded in Rohatyn. The interviewer – Marta Havryshko.</p>
