                    <p>The central concept of the research project is «social void», a phenomenon that was characteristic of Central and Eastern Europe during and immediately after World War II as a result of mass ethnic cleansing, political revolutions, forced displacement and migration. The project focuses both on the material dimension of post-war social change (e.g. acquisition of property) and the subjective sphere of social practices and relationships. His goal was to examine the processes of replacing the missing elements of social life with local communities of Poland and Ukraine. The interviews conducted as part of the project show how the void was filled after the social groups (e.g. landowners, wealthy peasants), representatives of ethnic communities (Jews, Poles, Ukrainians) and professional groups (e.g. shoemakers, pharmacists, doctors, or more broadly – craftsmen, intelligence) were evicted by the war and post-war changes. The analysis concerns changes in the ownership structure, economic dysfunction, transformations of social and cultural practices, as well as changes in relations and social norms. The conversations archived at the Center were recorded in a dozen of locations in Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk and Ternopil regions by an interdisciplinary team of Polish-Ukrainian researchers. The research was carried out in small towns and villages, combining the methodology of microhistory and biographic interview as part of oral history. In total, almost 150 interviews were collected in Ukraine, of which 40 are currently available in UStories collection. The conversations recorded in Poland as part of this bilateral study are preserved in Warsaw at Archiwum Historii Mówionej. The project coordinator is Anna Wylegała, a researcher at the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Project is financed by the National Humanities Development Program, registration number 12H 13 0584 82. Galyna Bodnar worked with the materials before their publication.</p>

                        <p>An interview with a native and permanent resident of the town Bibrka, now Peremyshlyany district. The interviewee’s daughter was present during the interview and sometimes joined the conversation: rephrased the questions and occasionally complemented what her mother was saying. Childhood memories didn’t contain all the aspects of the pre-war history of the town, compared to, for example, smaller village communities members’ memories. The family of the narrator has a small shop in the house where they lived. Later, their house was neighbouring a ghetto in Bibrka; this is why the woman witnessed its creation, Jews staying there, starvation and attempts to get some food, hidings, and firing squads. The narrator tells in detail about the Jewish neighbours: places of residence, occupation, religious life, stereotypes. Regarding the pre-war life of the village, the woman recalled education at school, teachers and interethnic cohabitation of the village community. More detailed recollections about the german occupation contained details of the cantonment, eviction of the youth for works in Germany, education at school, teachers.<br />
Recorded in Bibrka. The interviewer – Anna Wylegała.</p>
