                    <p>The central concept of the research project is «social void», a phenomenon that was characteristic of Central and Eastern Europe during and immediately after World War II as a result of mass ethnic cleansing, political revolutions, forced displacement and migration. The project focuses both on the material dimension of post-war social change (e.g. acquisition of property) and the subjective sphere of social practices and relationships. His goal was to examine the processes of replacing the missing elements of social life with local communities of Poland and Ukraine. The interviews conducted as part of the project show how the void was filled after the social groups (e.g. landowners, wealthy peasants), representatives of ethnic communities (Jews, Poles, Ukrainians) and professional groups (e.g. shoemakers, pharmacists, doctors, or more broadly – craftsmen, intelligence) were evicted by the war and post-war changes. The analysis concerns changes in the ownership structure, economic dysfunction, transformations of social and cultural practices, as well as changes in relations and social norms. The conversations archived at the Center were recorded in a dozen of locations in Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk and Ternopil regions by an interdisciplinary team of Polish-Ukrainian researchers. The research was carried out in small towns and villages, combining the methodology of microhistory and biographic interview as part of oral history. In total, almost 150 interviews were collected in Ukraine, of which 40 are currently available in UStories collection. The conversations recorded in Poland as part of this bilateral study are preserved in Warsaw at Archiwum Historii Mówionej. The project coordinator is Anna Wylegała, a researcher at the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Project is financed by the National Humanities Development Program, registration number 12H 13 0584 82. Galyna Bodnar worked with the materials before their publication.</p>

                        <p>An interview with a native and permanent resident of the village Kuriany, now Berezhany district of Ternopil district. The conversation is abrupt and unstructured and the answers are somewhat fragmentary; the interviewee mostly just answered the questions of the interviewer. A woman was born to a Ukrainian-Polish family (her mother was Polish). From the pre-war period, the woman recalled education at school and teachers; she also vaguely recalled interethnic cohabitation. She told about the village lord (didych) and his family, attitude to the villagers, and the religious life. The narrator recalled the names and occupations of Jews who lived in Kuriany, their exile to the ghetto created in Berezhany, and shootings. The small number of Polish villagers were still the reason for the aggravation of the Ukrainian-Polish opposition during the war. In the interview, the participants to the conflict from both parties, the deceased, as well as those collaborating with the German and Soviet government, are personified. The woman tells about the post-war eviction of Polish villagers and the coming of Ukrainians from Poland, including how they arranged their lives and formed relationships with the local population. The memories about teachers coming from Eastern Ukraine and the attitude of the locals and the Ukrainian underground to them are fragmentary.<br />
Recorded in Kuriany. The interviewer – Anna Wylegała.</p>
