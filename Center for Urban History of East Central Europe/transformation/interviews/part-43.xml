                    <p>The central concept of the research project is «social void», a phenomenon that was characteristic of Central and Eastern Europe during and immediately after World War II as a result of mass ethnic cleansing, political revolutions, forced displacement and migration. The project focuses both on the material dimension of post-war social change (e.g. acquisition of property) and the subjective sphere of social practices and relationships. His goal was to examine the processes of replacing the missing elements of social life with local communities of Poland and Ukraine. The interviews conducted as part of the project show how the void was filled after the social groups (e.g. landowners, wealthy peasants), representatives of ethnic communities (Jews, Poles, Ukrainians) and professional groups (e.g. shoemakers, pharmacists, doctors, or more broadly – craftsmen, intelligence) were evicted by the war and post-war changes. The analysis concerns changes in the ownership structure, economic dysfunction, transformations of social and cultural practices, as well as changes in relations and social norms. The conversations archived at the Center were recorded in a dozen of locations in Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk and Ternopil regions by an interdisciplinary team of Polish-Ukrainian researchers. The research was carried out in small towns and villages, combining the methodology of microhistory and biographic interview as part of oral history. In total, almost 150 interviews were collected in Ukraine, of which 40 are currently available in UStories collection. The conversations recorded in Poland as part of this bilateral study are preserved in Warsaw at Archiwum Historii Mówionej. The project coordinator is Anna Wylegała, a researcher at the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Project is financed by the National Humanities Development Program, registration number 12H 13 0584 82. Galyna Bodnar worked with the materials before their publication.</p>

                        <p>An interview with a native and permanent resident of the village Barysh, now Buchach district of Ternopil oblast. The interviewee’s daughter was present and constantly joined the conversation, rephrasing the questions, expanding on what her mother told, and adding comments of her own. Because of the age, the narrator often complained of the already poor memory. The interview started with the detailed history of the interviewee’s family. The woman also told about the family of Jews who lived nearby, their occupations, their children going to school together with her daughter. During the occupation, she was hiding the head of this family for some time (she started to live in his house since then). The narrator witnessed the shooting of a group of Jews who were hiding in the woods; they were escorted near her house. A separate conversation thread is the massacre of local Poles by Ukrainian nationalist underground, their burial in the cemetery, hiding the saved Poles in the houses of Ukrainian villagers, aggravated mutual hostility. The woman also recalled the Polish landowner, owner of the manor, who was repressed by the Soviet government and whose property was first taken by the local population and then used for the collective farm needs. Towards the end of the war, Ukrainians resettled from Poland inhabited the houses of the deceased and evicted Poles. The woman tells about the arrangements they made, their relationships with the local population, as well as about the post-war life of the village as such.<br />
Recorded in Barash. The interviewer – Marta Havryshko.   </p>
