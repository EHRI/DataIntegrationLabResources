                    <p>The central concept of the research project is «social void», a phenomenon that was characteristic of Central and Eastern Europe during and immediately after World War II as a result of mass ethnic cleansing, political revolutions, forced displacement and migration. The project focuses both on the material dimension of post-war social change (e.g. acquisition of property) and the subjective sphere of social practices and relationships. His goal was to examine the processes of replacing the missing elements of social life with local communities of Poland and Ukraine. The interviews conducted as part of the project show how the void was filled after the social groups (e.g. landowners, wealthy peasants), representatives of ethnic communities (Jews, Poles, Ukrainians) and professional groups (e.g. shoemakers, pharmacists, doctors, or more broadly – craftsmen, intelligence) were evicted by the war and post-war changes. The analysis concerns changes in the ownership structure, economic dysfunction, transformations of social and cultural practices, as well as changes in relations and social norms. The conversations archived at the Center were recorded in a dozen of locations in Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk and Ternopil regions by an interdisciplinary team of Polish-Ukrainian researchers. The research was carried out in small towns and villages, combining the methodology of microhistory and biographic interview as part of oral history. In total, almost 150 interviews were collected in Ukraine, of which 40 are currently available in UStories collection. The conversations recorded in Poland as part of this bilateral study are preserved in Warsaw at Archiwum Historii Mówionej. The project coordinator is Anna Wylegała, a researcher at the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Project is financed by the National Humanities Development Program, registration number 12H 13 0584 82. Galyna Bodnar worked with the materials before their publication.</p>

                        <p>An interview with a native resident of the village Halych of Berezhany (now Pidhaitsi) district in Ternopil oblast. The man was born to a large family. He told about his education at school during the German occupation, the life of the Ukrainian community before the war, Ukrainian-Polish cohabitation, a few Jewish neighbours and their occupations, the Roman Catholic church in Pidhaitsi. A separate conversation thread was the eviction of the Polish population to Poland, the fate of their property and households, the resettlement of Ukrainians in Pidhaitsi and its neighbourhoods. The man witnessed the creation of a ghetto in Pidhaitsi when he was a boy, a pupil of a school in Pidhaitsi. For the man, the memories of the Jews from Pidhaitsi are the memories of their partly preserved cemetery, as well as of the Synagogue and how it was used during the Soviet times. More detailed are the memories of post-war life: repressions of the Soviet government, forced collectivization, teachers coming to work from the Eastern regions.<br />
Recorded in Pidhaitsi. The interviewer – Anna Wylegała.</p>
