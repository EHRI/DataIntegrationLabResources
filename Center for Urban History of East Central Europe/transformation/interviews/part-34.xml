                    <p>The central concept of the research project is «social void», a phenomenon that was characteristic of Central and Eastern Europe during and immediately after World War II as a result of mass ethnic cleansing, political revolutions, forced displacement and migration. The project focuses both on the material dimension of post-war social change (e.g. acquisition of property) and the subjective sphere of social practices and relationships. His goal was to examine the processes of replacing the missing elements of social life with local communities of Poland and Ukraine. The interviews conducted as part of the project show how the void was filled after the social groups (e.g. landowners, wealthy peasants), representatives of ethnic communities (Jews, Poles, Ukrainians) and professional groups (e.g. shoemakers, pharmacists, doctors, or more broadly – craftsmen, intelligence) were evicted by the war and post-war changes. The analysis concerns changes in the ownership structure, economic dysfunction, transformations of social and cultural practices, as well as changes in relations and social norms. The conversations archived at the Center were recorded in a dozen of locations in Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk and Ternopil regions by an interdisciplinary team of Polish-Ukrainian researchers. The research was carried out in small towns and villages, combining the methodology of microhistory and biographic interview as part of oral history. In total, almost 150 interviews were collected in Ukraine, of which 40 are currently available in UStories collection. The conversations recorded in Poland as part of this bilateral study are preserved in Warsaw at Archiwum Historii Mówionej. The project coordinator is Anna Wylegała, a researcher at the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Project is financed by the National Humanities Development Program, registration number 12H 13 0584 82. Galyna Bodnar worked with the materials before their publication.</p>

                        <p>An interview with a native resident of the village Stratyn, Rohatyn district in Ivano Frankivsk oblast. The narrator and her parents were repressed by the Soviet government in 1944; her father died in exile in Arkhangelsk and the mother managed to escape and returned. The woman spent 17 years in exile, married another political prisoner there, and gave birth to two children. The narrator remembered a lot of Jewish neighbours of the village Stratyn and described in detail their families, places of residence, occupations and traditions. During the German occupation, all Jews in Stratyn – first, the man, and then, women and children too – were taken to the ghetto in Rohatyn and, after a certain time, shot. The woman recalled several stories about Jews hiding in the nearby villages and in Rohatyn, the fate of their property, houses and households. The narrator told about how she went to the Rohatyn ghetto to buy a shawl. The woman was a nurse in the Ukrainian nationalist underground and shared her memories of the girls taught nursing, doctors (there were Jews among them), and paramedics of the underground, the cases of providing help, her tasks in intelligence and showing the way to underground detachments. The conversation is full of names and pseudonyms of the rebels, information about the fate of some of them. A separate conversation thread is an exile in Vorkuta, the death of her father there, the limitations this posed for the children’s ability to gain education back home.<br />
Recorded in Stratyn. The interviewer – Marta Havryshko.</p>
