                    <p>The central concept of the research project is «social void», a phenomenon that was characteristic of Central and Eastern Europe during and immediately after World War II as a result of mass ethnic cleansing, political revolutions, forced displacement and migration. The project focuses both on the material dimension of post-war social change (e.g. acquisition of property) and the subjective sphere of social practices and relationships. His goal was to examine the processes of replacing the missing elements of social life with local communities of Poland and Ukraine. The interviews conducted as part of the project show how the void was filled after the social groups (e.g. landowners, wealthy peasants), representatives of ethnic communities (Jews, Poles, Ukrainians) and professional groups (e.g. shoemakers, pharmacists, doctors, or more broadly – craftsmen, intelligence) were evicted by the war and post-war changes. The analysis concerns changes in the ownership structure, economic dysfunction, transformations of social and cultural practices, as well as changes in relations and social norms. The conversations archived at the Center were recorded in a dozen of locations in Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk and Ternopil regions by an interdisciplinary team of Polish-Ukrainian researchers. The research was carried out in small towns and villages, combining the methodology of microhistory and biographic interview as part of oral history. In total, almost 150 interviews were collected in Ukraine, of which 40 are currently available in UStories collection. The conversations recorded in Poland as part of this bilateral study are preserved in Warsaw at Archiwum Historii Mówionej. The project coordinator is Anna Wylegała, a researcher at the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Project is financed by the National Humanities Development Program, registration number 12H 13 0584 82. Galyna Bodnar worked with the materials before their publication.</p>

                        <p>An interview with a native resident of the village Vorvulyntsi, Zalishchyky district of Ternopil oblast. The woman told about her family, education at school, pre-war village community, and shared her childhood memories about the Ukrainian cultural and national life of the village. During the German occupation, the woman studied in the nearby town Tovste and witnessed the Jews staying in a ghetto in the village Holovchyntsi; she recalls the stories of people hiding and giving away Jews. A large part of the interview was concerned with the restoration of the Soviet government and post-war years. The woman had to work a lot as a teenager helping her mother manage the household as her father and older brother were mobilized to the Soviet Army in 1944. The narrator went through an arrest and interrogation at the Soviet garrison prison when her family was accused of hiding participants of the Ukrainian nationalist underground. In 1952 she graduated from the pedagogical school in Chortkiv and was sent to work as a teacher at the high school of the town Tovste. The woman recalls the years of teaching, everyday life, repressions of the Soviet government and its anti-church policy, eviction of the Poles and resettlement of Ukrainians from Poland.<br />
Recorded in Tovste. The interviewer – Anna Chebotariova.</p>
