                    <p>The central concept of the research project is «social void», a phenomenon that was characteristic of Central and Eastern Europe during and immediately after World War II as a result of mass ethnic cleansing, political revolutions, forced displacement and migration. The project focuses both on the material dimension of post-war social change (e.g. acquisition of property) and the subjective sphere of social practices and relationships. His goal was to examine the processes of replacing the missing elements of social life with local communities of Poland and Ukraine. The interviews conducted as part of the project show how the void was filled after the social groups (e.g. landowners, wealthy peasants), representatives of ethnic communities (Jews, Poles, Ukrainians) and professional groups (e.g. shoemakers, pharmacists, doctors, or more broadly – craftsmen, intelligence) were evicted by the war and post-war changes. The analysis concerns changes in the ownership structure, economic dysfunction, transformations of social and cultural practices, as well as changes in relations and social norms. The conversations archived at the Center were recorded in a dozen of locations in Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk and Ternopil regions by an interdisciplinary team of Polish-Ukrainian researchers. The research was carried out in small towns and villages, combining the methodology of microhistory and biographic interview as part of oral history. In total, almost 150 interviews were collected in Ukraine, of which 40 are currently available in UStories collection. The conversations recorded in Poland as part of this bilateral study are preserved in Warsaw at Archiwum Historii Mówionej. The project coordinator is Anna Wylegała, a researcher at the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Project is financed by the National Humanities Development Program, registration number 12H 13 0584 82. Galyna Bodnar worked with the materials before their publication.</p>

                        <p>An interview with a native resident of the village Osivtsi of Buchach district in Ternopil oblast. The interviewee’s daughter was present during the conversation, occasionally joined it, asking additional questions to her father and expanding on what he was saying. It was obvious that the man didn’t want to give many details of what he saw and survived; he mentioned he had already “told too much.” The narrator recalled working on the farm, the Polish landlord of the village, his participation in the “Polish war”, his wife and daughters who were arrested and sent to Siberia, a school organized in their manor, which was later disassembled. The man talked about the establishment of the Soviet government in 1939 and the reaction to this of the local population. In 1942, there was a big fire in the village, and part of the houses, a Roman and a Greek Catholic church buildings burnt to ashes. The interviewee shared his memories of the Jewish villagers, their occupations and traditions, peculiar stereotypes, a ghetto in Buchach, the fate of Jews’ property and households, the stories of hiding Jews, one rescued girl who never revealed her origins even when she grew up. When asked about the Ukrainian-Polish opposition in the village, the narrator expressed his assumptions but demonstrated that he didn’t want to dig deeper into that topic. A separate conversation thread is serving in the Soviet army. He was mobilized in 1944, which he described in much detail; he returned to the village in 1948.            <br />
Recorded in Osivtsi. The interviewer – Marta Havryshko.</p>
