                    <p>The central concept of the research project is «social void», a phenomenon that was characteristic of Central and Eastern Europe during and immediately after World War II as a result of mass ethnic cleansing, political revolutions, forced displacement and migration. The project focuses both on the material dimension of post-war social change (e.g. acquisition of property) and the subjective sphere of social practices and relationships. His goal was to examine the processes of replacing the missing elements of social life with local communities of Poland and Ukraine. The interviews conducted as part of the project show how the void was filled after the social groups (e.g. landowners, wealthy peasants), representatives of ethnic communities (Jews, Poles, Ukrainians) and professional groups (e.g. shoemakers, pharmacists, doctors, or more broadly – craftsmen, intelligence) were evicted by the war and post-war changes. The analysis concerns changes in the ownership structure, economic dysfunction, transformations of social and cultural practices, as well as changes in relations and social norms. The conversations archived at the Center were recorded in a dozen of locations in Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk and Ternopil regions by an interdisciplinary team of Polish-Ukrainian researchers. The research was carried out in small towns and villages, combining the methodology of microhistory and biographic interview as part of oral history. In total, almost 150 interviews were collected in Ukraine, of which 40 are currently available in UStories collection. The conversations recorded in Poland as part of this bilateral study are preserved in Warsaw at Archiwum Historii Mówionej. The project coordinator is Anna Wylegała, a researcher at the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Project is financed by the National Humanities Development Program, registration number 12H 13 0584 82. Galyna Bodnar worked with the materials before their publication.</p>

                        <p>An interview with a native and permanent resident of the village Koropets, now Monastyryskyi district of Ternopil oblast. A woman was born to a Ukrainian-Polish family and was baptized in a Roman Catholic Church. In times of war, the woman studied outside of the village, which is why she knew little of the life of her village during the German occupation. She started her narration by describing the charms of the manor before war: its garden and interior of the palace, the family of a landlord and its life, the work of local villagers in the household. The woman shared her childhood memories about religious traditions and the coexistence of various nations that made up a village community. She spoke about numerous classmates-Jews, their families, occupations, places of residence, as well as Jewing buildings in the village, their fate after the war, a synagogue in particular. A separate conversation thread is the forced deportation of local Jews into a ghetto in Buchach and further shootings of those who remained or managed to return to the village centre. The woman tells in detail about the deportation of the Polish villagers to Poland in the post-war years: the motifs, the circumstances of departure, the fate of the abandoned property. Towards the end of the interview, the focus shifts towards the post-war life of the interviewee: financial situation, work, everyday life, social sphere, and medicine. The woman also emphasized the aggravation of a Ukrainian-Polish opposition during the war, the burning of the neighboring village Puzhnyky in 1945, the repressions of the Soviet government, the teachers coming from the East of Ukraine.<br />
