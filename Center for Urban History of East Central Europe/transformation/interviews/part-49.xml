                    <p>The central concept of the research project is «social void», a phenomenon that was characteristic of Central and Eastern Europe during and immediately after World War II as a result of mass ethnic cleansing, political revolutions, forced displacement and migration. The project focuses both on the material dimension of post-war social change (e.g. acquisition of property) and the subjective sphere of social practices and relationships. His goal was to examine the processes of replacing the missing elements of social life with local communities of Poland and Ukraine. The interviews conducted as part of the project show how the void was filled after the social groups (e.g. landowners, wealthy peasants), representatives of ethnic communities (Jews, Poles, Ukrainians) and professional groups (e.g. shoemakers, pharmacists, doctors, or more broadly – craftsmen, intelligence) were evicted by the war and post-war changes. The analysis concerns changes in the ownership structure, economic dysfunction, transformations of social and cultural practices, as well as changes in relations and social norms. The conversations archived at the Center were recorded in a dozen of locations in Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk and Ternopil regions by an interdisciplinary team of Polish-Ukrainian researchers. The research was carried out in small towns and villages, combining the methodology of microhistory and biographic interview as part of oral history. In total, almost 150 interviews were collected in Ukraine, of which 40 are currently available in UStories collection. The conversations recorded in Poland as part of this bilateral study are preserved in Warsaw at Archiwum Historii Mówionej. The project coordinator is Anna Wylegała, a researcher at the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Project is financed by the National Humanities Development Program, registration number 12H 13 0584 82. Galyna Bodnar worked with the materials before their publication.</p>

                        <p>An interview with a native and permanent resident of the town Bibrka, now Peremyshlyany district of Lviv oblast. The publicity of the narrator who was invited to share his memories in several other research projects already was perceived during the interview. A man was born to a Ukrainian-Polish family (his mother was Polish). He told about his education at school in Bibrka in the pre-war period, where Polish, Ukrainian and Jewish children studied together. The conversation was also concerned with the pre-war daily lives of the multinational town citizens. The narrator recalls Jewish families on his street and in the town in general: their names and surnames, places of residence, occupation, as well as the establishment of the Soviet government in Bibrka and the repressions against Polish governors and entrepreneurs, the massacre of Jews in the town’s centre after the retreat of the Soviet government in June 1941. The interviewee demarcated the margins of the ghetto in the town, described how the Jews lived there, their fate and the fate of their property, told the story of one rescued teenager and one of his saviors. The man recalls very well a lot of Polish citizens evicted to Poland after the war; he named their names and occupation.  <br />
Recorded in Bibrka. The interviewer – Marta Havryshko.</p>
