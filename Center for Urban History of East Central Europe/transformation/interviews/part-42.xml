                    <p>The central concept of the research project is «social void», a phenomenon that was characteristic of Central and Eastern Europe during and immediately after World War II as a result of mass ethnic cleansing, political revolutions, forced displacement and migration. The project focuses both on the material dimension of post-war social change (e.g. acquisition of property) and the subjective sphere of social practices and relationships. His goal was to examine the processes of replacing the missing elements of social life with local communities of Poland and Ukraine. The interviews conducted as part of the project show how the void was filled after the social groups (e.g. landowners, wealthy peasants), representatives of ethnic communities (Jews, Poles, Ukrainians) and professional groups (e.g. shoemakers, pharmacists, doctors, or more broadly – craftsmen, intelligence) were evicted by the war and post-war changes. The analysis concerns changes in the ownership structure, economic dysfunction, transformations of social and cultural practices, as well as changes in relations and social norms. The conversations archived at the Center were recorded in a dozen of locations in Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk and Ternopil regions by an interdisciplinary team of Polish-Ukrainian researchers. The research was carried out in small towns and villages, combining the methodology of microhistory and biographic interview as part of oral history. In total, almost 150 interviews were collected in Ukraine, of which 40 are currently available in UStories collection. The conversations recorded in Poland as part of this bilateral study are preserved in Warsaw at Archiwum Historii Mówionej. The project coordinator is Anna Wylegała, a researcher at the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Project is financed by the National Humanities Development Program, registration number 12H 13 0584 82. Galyna Bodnar worked with the materials before their publication.</p>

                        <p>An interview with a woman born in the village Ushnya, Olesko, now Zolochiv district of Lviv oblast. The woman was born to the Ukrainian-Polish family; she told about the pre-war village community, numerous Polish and several Jewish families, their peaceful interethnic cohabitation. The interviewee tells briefly about education at school, the establishment of the Soviet government in 1939 and shootings of prisoners in Zolochiv before the departure, German occupation and hiding not to be taken to work in Germany (a relative arranged for work in Lviv for the interviewee to avoid the eviction), induced help to the Ukrainian underground, eviction of the Polish villagers to Poland, forced collectivization, post-war repressions of the Soviet government. The narrator had a Jewish classmate, made friends with her and stayed at her home. This Jewish girl was hiding in the woods near the village for a year, but their hiding place was exposed, and they were shot. The woman recalls what happened to the abandoned property, lands and households of the Jewish, Polish and evicted population. A separate conversation thread is devoted to Ukrainians resettled from Poland as the interviewee married one in 1946.<br />
Recorded in Zolochiv. The interviewer – Marta Havryshko.</p>
