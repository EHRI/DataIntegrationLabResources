                    <p>The central concept of the research project is «social void», a phenomenon that was characteristic of Central and Eastern Europe during and immediately after World War II as a result of mass ethnic cleansing, political revolutions, forced displacement and migration. The project focuses both on the material dimension of post-war social change (e.g. acquisition of property) and the subjective sphere of social practices and relationships. His goal was to examine the processes of replacing the missing elements of social life with local communities of Poland and Ukraine. The interviews conducted as part of the project show how the void was filled after the social groups (e.g. landowners, wealthy peasants), representatives of ethnic communities (Jews, Poles, Ukrainians) and professional groups (e.g. shoemakers, pharmacists, doctors, or more broadly – craftsmen, intelligence) were evicted by the war and post-war changes. The analysis concerns changes in the ownership structure, economic dysfunction, transformations of social and cultural practices, as well as changes in relations and social norms. The conversations archived at the Center were recorded in a dozen of locations in Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk and Ternopil regions by an interdisciplinary team of Polish-Ukrainian researchers. The research was carried out in small towns and villages, combining the methodology of microhistory and biographic interview as part of oral history. In total, almost 150 interviews were collected in Ukraine, of which 40 are currently available in UStories collection. The conversations recorded in Poland as part of this bilateral study are preserved in Warsaw at Archiwum Historii Mówionej. The project coordinator is Anna Wylegała, a researcher at the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Project is financed by the National Humanities Development Program, registration number 12H 13 0584 82. Galyna Bodnar worked with the materials before their publication.</p>

                        <p>An interview with a native resident of the village Slovita of Zolochiv district in Lviv oblast. The man remembered well the pre-war and war periods; the interview is full of details and names of fellow villagers or diverse nationalities. A narrator described in detail the pre-war interethnic community of the village Slovita, the landlord of the village and his fate. The man touched upon the topic of labor migration abroad during the interwar period: his father worked in Argentina on the verge of the 1920ies and 1930ies, just like many other villagers, and lost all the earnings during the collectivization. The interview has information about the ethnic makeup of the neighbouring villages, the establishment of the Soviet power and repressions, the German government, aggravation of the Ukrainian-Polish conflict and common fear during the restoration of the Soviet government, collectivization, and first heads of the collective farms. The man grew up with the Jewish boy and talks in detail about the shootings of Jews in the neighbourhoods of Slovita in the summer of 1943. When the man studied in Lviv in the post-war years, he had an opportunity to observe local intellectuals (Mykhailo Vozniak and Ilarion Svientsitski in particular) and teachers who came from the East of Ukraine. He shared memories of the relationships in the student community of the time. <br />
Recorded in Zolochiv. The interviewer – Natalia Otrishchenko.</p>
