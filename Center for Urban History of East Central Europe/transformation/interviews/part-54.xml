                    <p>The central concept of the research project is «social void», a phenomenon that was characteristic of Central and Eastern Europe during and immediately after World War II as a result of mass ethnic cleansing, political revolutions, forced displacement and migration. The project focuses both on the material dimension of post-war social change (e.g. acquisition of property) and the subjective sphere of social practices and relationships. His goal was to examine the processes of replacing the missing elements of social life with local communities of Poland and Ukraine. The interviews conducted as part of the project show how the void was filled after the social groups (e.g. landowners, wealthy peasants), representatives of ethnic communities (Jews, Poles, Ukrainians) and professional groups (e.g. shoemakers, pharmacists, doctors, or more broadly – craftsmen, intelligence) were evicted by the war and post-war changes. The analysis concerns changes in the ownership structure, economic dysfunction, transformations of social and cultural practices, as well as changes in relations and social norms. The conversations archived at the Center were recorded in a dozen of locations in Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk and Ternopil regions by an interdisciplinary team of Polish-Ukrainian researchers. The research was carried out in small towns and villages, combining the methodology of microhistory and biographic interview as part of oral history. In total, almost 150 interviews were collected in Ukraine, of which 40 are currently available in UStories collection. The conversations recorded in Poland as part of this bilateral study are preserved in Warsaw at Archiwum Historii Mówionej. The project coordinator is Anna Wylegała, a researcher at the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Project is financed by the National Humanities Development Program, registration number 12H 13 0584 82. Galyna Bodnar worked with the materials before their publication.</p>

                        <p>An interview with a native and permanent resident of the village Koropets, now Monastyryskyi district of Ternopil oblast. A man was a small boy in times of war but told a lot of stories he heard from his mother and relatives. The interview is full of details about post-war Soviet life and information about the history of the man’s village and its neighbourhoods. The narrator’s daughter was present towards the end of the interview and occasionally clarified her father. The man comes from a family of Ukrainians but used the example of his close relatives to illustrate the difficult cohabitation of the Ukrainians and the Polish before the war, frequent interethnic marriages, deportation to Poland. He spoke about a manor and a household in the village, hired labor, the fate of the landowner and his family, aggravation of a Ukrainian-Polish conflict during the war. A separate conversation thread is a ghetto in Koropets and the fate of the local Jews and their property, firing squads, stories of individual rescued Jews. The memories of the post-war Soviet life of the village are more extensive: the man recalls the relocation of Ukrainians from Poland, the arrangements at a school, the teachers coming from the Easters regions, Ukrainian nationalist underground.<br />
Recorded in Koropets. The interviewer – Anna Wylegała.</p>
