                    <p>The ensemble of Bohomoltsia Street was built in 1904-1908 by Ivan Levynskyy’s architectural and construction bureau and is a great example of Secession in Lviv. This small and cozy street that was designed for the city’s middle class witnessed the turbulence of the 20th century and can be used as a case study for tracking down Lviv’s past. The project “Lviv in the 20th Century: The History of One Street” was one of the first oral history studies implemented by the Center for Urban History. It was initially entitled “The Oral History of Bohomoltsia Street” and aimed to document the stories of the street’s current residents – their experience of settling in, living conditions, awareness of the history of their building/ street/ district, communication with other parts of the city. The conversations revolved around their everyday life, their contacts with the neighbors, and the degree to which their daily routines were linked to their building/ street/ district. In this context, the experience of each individual resident is an important piece of a broader historical picture as the interviewees talked about resettlement, turbulent postwar times, and interethnic relationships. These individual stories give buildings and streets a human face and attribute a more personal meaning to remote historical notions and hard statistical data. The development of methodology and fieldwork within the frame of this research project was implemented by Halyna Bodnar. Alina Zhurbenko has prepared these materials for their presentation on the web.</p>

                        <p>Interview with the narrator consists from two thematical parts. First one provides context to lifestyle of youngsters in Soviet Lviv. The narrator tells about books, clothes and free time he used to have in those times, shares his own experience. He collects old books and photographs of Lviv in different times, interests in city history in general and Bohomoltsia Street particularly. This can be heard in second thematical part of the interview, when the narrator demonstrates his collection of old digitized images of Lviv streets. This part is full of old names of the streets and incoherent details about city's past. There are prolonged pauses indicated in the scriptogram (for example, (.5), where the pause length is estimated (in seconds) after the dot).<br />
The recording was performed on August 29, 2008. Interviewer – Halyna Bodnar.</p>

                    <p>The project “The Search for Home in Postwar Lviv: The Experience of Pidzamche, 1944-1960” aimed to illuminate one of the most complicated pages in the history of contemporary Lviv – its transformation from the frontier Polish city of Lwόw and German-occupied Lemberg into a Soviet and then Ukrainian city. This traumatic and controversial experience of the city’s radical transformation by the Soviets is presented through the stories of various people who began their new postwar life in Lviv’s district of Pidzamche. The project aspired to ‘capture’ the life pathways of Pidzamche’s inhabitants and the experience of the postwar transformation of one of Lviv’s oldest districts, the place of the Jewish ghetto during World War II, and a site for postwar industrialization. It turned into the crossroads of ideology and daily routines, the human and the political, the old and the new, remembrance and obliteration. The research was conducted under the program "Historical Workshop Europe", financed by the German Federal Fund "Memory, Responsibility, Future", and coordinated by the Institute for Applied History in Frankfurt (Oder) and the European University Viadrina. The field part of the project (collecting data by in-depth interviewing) was implemented in the summer of 2012. The methodology for conversations was elaborated by the Center for Urban History’s team. The project was coordinated by Andriy Bondarenko. The interviews were done by Halyna Bodnar, Natalia Otrishchenko, Anna Chebotariova, and Andriy Shuliar. The project collected a total of 25 interviews; for confidentiality reasons, there is open access to 23 of them. Interviews were conducted in Ukrainian or Russian. Reference to the collection: Based on the materials of the UStories project of the Center for Urban History of East Central Europe, collection “Search for Home: Experience of Postwar Pidzamche, 1944-1960”.

                    <p>The project “The Search for Home in Postwar Lviv: The Experience of Pidzamche, 1944-1960” aimed to illuminate one of the most complicated pages in the history of contemporary Lviv – its transformation from the frontier Polish city of Lwόw and German-occupied Lemberg into a Soviet and then Ukrainian city. This traumatic and controversial experience of the city’s radical transformation by the Soviets is presented through the stories of various people who began their new postwar life in Lviv’s district of Pidzamche. The project aspired to ‘capture’ the life pathways of Pidzamche’s inhabitants and the experience of the postwar transformation of one of Lviv’s oldest districts, the place of the Jewish ghetto during World War II, and a site for postwar industrialization. It turned into the crossroads of ideology and daily routines, the human and the political, the old and the new, remembrance and obliteration. The research was conducted under the program "Historical Workshop Europe", financed by the German Federal Fund "Memory, Responsibility, Future", and coordinated by the Institute for Applied History in Frankfurt (Oder) and the European University Viadrina. The field part of the project (collecting data by in-depth interviewing) was implemented in the summer of 2012. The methodology for conversations was elaborated by the Center for Urban History’s team. The project was coordinated by Andriy Bondarenko. The interviews were done by Halyna Bodnar, Natalia Otrishchenko, Anna Chebotariova, and Andriy Shuliar. The project collected a total of 25 interviews; for confidentiality reasons, there is open access to 23 of them. Interviews were conducted in Ukrainian or Russian. Reference to the collection: Based on the materials of the UStories project of the Center for Urban History of East Central Europe, collection “Search for Home: Experience of Postwar Pidzamche, 1944-1960”. Reference to the interview: Interview with sex, born in year of birth, recorded date of the interview.

                    <p>The project “The Search for Home in Postwar Lviv: The Experience of Pidzamche, 1944-1960” aimed to illuminate one of the most complicated pages in the history of contemporary Lviv – its transformation from the frontier Polish city of Lwόw and German-occupied Lemberg into a Soviet and then Ukrainian city. This traumatic and controversial experience of the city’s radical transformation by the Soviets is presented through the stories of various people who began their new postwar life in Lviv’s district of Pidzamche. The project aspired to ‘capture’ the life pathways of Pidzamche’s inhabitants and the experience of the postwar transformation of one of Lviv’s oldest districts, the place of the Jewish ghetto during World War II, and a site for postwar industrialization. It turned into the crossroads of ideology and daily routines, the human and the political, the old and the new, remembrance and obliteration. The research was conducted under the program "Historical Workshop Europe", financed by the German Federal Fund "Memory, Responsibility, Future", and coordinated by the Institute for Applied History in Frankfurt (Oder) and the European University Viadrina.

                    <p>The project “The Search for Home in Postwar Lviv: The Experience of Pidzamche, 1944-1960” aimed to illuminate one of the most complicated pages in the history of contemporary Lviv – its transformation from the frontier Polish city of Lwόw and German-occupied Lemberg into a Soviet and then Ukrainian city. This traumatic and controversial experience of the city’s radical transformation by the Soviets is presented through the stories of various people who began their new postwar life in Lviv’s district of Pidzamche. The project aspired to ‘capture’ the life pathways of Pidzamche’s inhabitants and the experience of the postwar transformation of one of Lviv’s oldest districts, the place of the Jewish ghetto during World War II, and a site for postwar industrialization. It turned into the crossroads of ideology and daily routines, the human and the political, the old and the new, remembrance and obliteration. The research was conducted under the program "Historical Workshop Europe", financed by the German Federal Fund "Memory, Responsibility, Future", and coordinated by the Institute for Applied History in Frankfurt (Oder) and the European University Viadrina. The field part of the project (collecting data by in-depth interviewing) was implemented in the summer of 2012. The methodology for conversations was elaborated by the Center for Urban History’s team. The project was coordinated by Andriy Bondarenko. The interviews were done by Halyna Bodnar, Natalia Otrishchenko, Anna Chebotariova, and Andriy Shuliar. The project collected a total of 25 interviews; for confidentiality reasons, there is open access to 23 of them. Interviews were conducted in Ukrainian or Russian. Reference to the collection: Based on the materials of the UStories project of the Center for Urban History of East Central Europe, collection “Search for Home: Experience of Postwar Pidzamche, 1944-1960”.

                        <p>An interview with the resident of Zamarstyniv area, a former employee of one of the educational institutions in Lviv. The woman recalls prewar Lviv, briefly tells about the war and the arrival of Soviet troops, describes her street and neighbours, returns to the topic of language several times when discussing the political changes. Another woman, a relative and neighbour of the interviewee, is present during the conversation and complements the story or helps to recall some facts from time to time. Sometimes the speech of the interviewee drops (due to her age and health), and it is not always possible to reproduce it word for word because of the poor quality of the recording and indistinct pronunciation.<br />
Recorded on 3rd August 2012 at the interviewee’s home. The interviewer – Halyna Bodnar.</p>

                    <p>The project “The Search for Home in Postwar Lviv: The Experience of Pidzamche, 1944-1960” aimed to illuminate one of the most complicated pages in the history of contemporary Lviv – its transformation from the frontier Polish city of Lwόw and German-occupied Lemberg into a Soviet and then Ukrainian city. This traumatic and controversial experience of the city’s radical transformation by the Soviets is presented through the stories of various people who began their new postwar life in Lviv’s district of Pidzamche. The project aspired to ‘capture’ the life pathways of Pidzamche’s inhabitants and the experience of the postwar transformation of one of Lviv’s oldest districts, the place of the Jewish ghetto during World War II, and a site for postwar industrialization. It turned into the crossroads of ideology and daily routines, the human and the political, the old and the new, remembrance and obliteration. The research was conducted under the program "Historical Workshop Europe", financed by the German Federal Fund "Memory, Responsibility, Future", and coordinated by the Institute for Applied History in Frankfurt (Oder) and the European University Viadrina. The field part of the project (collecting data by in-depth interviewing) was implemented in the summer of 2012. The methodology for conversations was elaborated by the Center for Urban History’s team. The project was coordinated by Andriy Bondarenko. The interviews were done by Halyna Bodnar, Natalia Otrishchenko, Anna Chebotariova, and Andriy Shuliar. The project collected a total of 25 interviews; for confidentiality reasons, there is open access to 23 of them. Interviews were conducted in Ukrainian or Russian. Reference to the collection: Based on the materials of the UStories project of the Center for Urban History of East Central Europe, collection “Search for Home: Experience of Postwar Pidzamche, 1944-1960”. Reference to the interview: Interview with sex, born in year of birth, recorded date of the interview.

                    <p>The project “The Search for Home in Postwar Lviv: The Experience of Pidzamche, 1944-1960” aimed to illuminate one of the most complicated pages in the history of contemporary Lviv – its transformation from the frontier Polish city of Lwόw and German-occupied Lemberg into a Soviet and then Ukrainian city. This traumatic and controversial experience of the city’s radical transformation by the Soviets is presented through the stories of various people who began their new postwar life in Lviv’s district of Pidzamche. The project aspired to ‘capture’ the life pathways of Pidzamche’s inhabitants and the experience of the postwar transformation of one of Lviv’s oldest districts, the place of the Jewish ghetto during World War II, and a site for postwar industrialization. It turned into the crossroads of ideology and daily routines, the human and the political, the old and the new, remembrance and obliteration. The research was conducted under the program "Historical Workshop Europe", financed by the German Federal Fund "Memory, Responsibility, Future", and coordinated by the Institute for Applied History in Frankfurt (Oder) and the European University Viadrina. The field part of the project (collecting data by in-depth interviewing) was implemented in the summer of 2012. The methodology for conversations was elaborated by the Center for Urban History’s team. The project was coordinated by Andriy Bondarenko. The interviews were done by Halyna Bodnar, Natalia Otrishchenko, Anna Chebotariova, and Andriy Shuliar. The project collected a total of 25 interviews; for confidentiality reasons, there is open access to 23 of them. Interviews were conducted in Ukrainian or Russian.

                        <p>An interview with the lecturer at the University of Veterinary Medicine and Biotechnology, an inborn resident of Pidzamche.

The interviewee recalls the history of her family, relationships with neighbours, schooling, spending leisure time, and, in general, everyday life in the postwar district. A separate part of the conversation is devoted to the challenges she faced while defending her PhD thesis. The interview has interesting stories from the past of the district, including the story about the mining of a railway bridge or the teaching of Ukrainian at school.<br />
Recorded on 6th August 2012 at the interviewee’s home. The interviewer – Andriy Bondarenko.</p>

                    <p>The central concept of the research project is «social void», a phenomenon that was characteristic of Central and Eastern Europe during and immediately after World War II as a result of mass ethnic cleansing, political revolutions, forced displacement and migration. The project focuses both on the material dimension of post-war social change (e.g. acquisition of property) and the subjective sphere of social practices and relationships. His goal was to examine the processes of replacing the missing elements of social life with local communities of Poland and Ukraine. The interviews conducted as part of the project show how the void was filled after the social groups (e.g. landowners, wealthy peasants), representatives of ethnic communities (Jews, Poles, Ukrainians) and professional groups (e.g. shoemakers, pharmacists, doctors, or more broadly – craftsmen, intelligence) were evicted by the war and post-war changes. The analysis concerns changes in the ownership structure, economic dysfunction, transformations of social and cultural practices, as well as changes in relations and social norms. The conversations archived at the Center were recorded in a dozen of locations in Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk and Ternopil regions by an interdisciplinary team of Polish-Ukrainian researchers. The research was carried out in small towns and villages, combining the methodology of microhistory and biographic interview as part of oral history. In total, almost 150 interviews were collected in Ukraine, of which 40 are currently available in UStories collection. The conversations recorded in Poland as part of this bilateral study are preserved in Warsaw at Archiwum Historii Mówionej. The project coordinator is Anna Wylegała, a researcher at the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Project is financed by the National Humanities Development Program, registration number 12H 13 0584 82. Galyna Bodnar worked with the materials before their publication.</p>

                        <p>An interview with a native resident of the village Slovita of Zolochiv district in Lviv oblast. The man remembered well the pre-war and war periods; the interview is full of details and names of fellow villagers or diverse nationalities. A narrator described in detail the pre-war interethnic community of the village Slovita, the landlord of the village and his fate. The man touched upon the topic of labor migration abroad during the interwar period: his father worked in Argentina on the verge of the 1920ies and 1930ies, just like many other villagers, and lost all the earnings during the collectivization. The interview has information about the ethnic makeup of the neighbouring villages, the establishment of the Soviet power and repressions, the German government, aggravation of the Ukrainian-Polish conflict and common fear during the restoration of the Soviet government, collectivization, and first heads of the collective farms. The man grew up with the Jewish boy and talks in detail about the shootings of Jews in the neighbourhoods of Slovita in the summer of 1943. When the man studied in Lviv in the post-war years, he had an opportunity to observe local intellectuals (Mykhailo Vozniak and Ilarion Svientsitski in particular) and teachers who came from the East of Ukraine. He shared memories of the relationships in the student community of the time. <br />

                        <p>An interview with a native resident of the town Zolochiv in Lviv oblast. The woman told about her childhood years, the household, neighbours, education at school, and teachers. During the German occupation, the family was compelled to share the house with a German soldier who occupied one of the rooms. A separate topic was a ghetto in the town, hiding and exposing information about Jews. The woman recalls the Ukrainian underground in Zolochiv, which was active when she was a teenager: random meeting in the town, the stories of hiding the rebels, and the firing squads. More detailed were the testimonies about the post-war life, the lack of food, repressions and exiles, forced eviction of the Polish population and the relocation of Ukrainians from Poland.<br />

The interviews conducted as part of the project show how the void was filled after the social groups (e.g. landowners, wealthy peasants), representatives of ethnic communities (Jews, Poles, Ukrainians) and professional groups (e.g. shoemakers, pharmacists, doctors, or more broadly – craftsmen, intelligence) were evicted by the war and post-war changes. The analysis concerns changes in the ownership structure, economic dysfunction, transformations of social and cultural practices, as well as changes in relations and social norms. The conversations archived at the Center were recorded in a dozen of locations in Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk and Ternopil regions by an interdisciplinary team of Polish-Ukrainian researchers. The research was carried out in small towns and villages, combining the methodology of microhistory and biographic interview as part of oral history. In total, almost 150 interviews were collected in Ukraine, of which 40 are currently available in UStories collection. The conversations recorded in Poland as part of this bilateral study are preserved in Warsaw at Archiwum Historii Mówionej. The project coordinator is Anna Wylegała, a researcher at the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Project is financed by the National Humanities Development Program, registration number 12H 13 0584 82. Galyna Bodnar worked with the materials before their publication.</p>

The narrator describes in detail various aspects of pre-war and war life; the conversation is full of details and personalities at the background of well-known events of the past. The man witnessed the entrance of the German army into Zolochiv, the burial of Sheptychky in Lviv, the mobilization of Ukrainian youth to the Soviet Army in 1944-1945. In 1945, the man was mobilized to the Soviet Army and served in the far East for almost eight years; in 1952, he moved to Lviv, and in 1960 – to Zolochiv. The man shares much details of his work on various enterprises in Lviv, Krasne and Zolochiv, the life of his family, and the fate of the relatives. Vivid were the memories of the pre-war life of the village community, interethnic relationships, occupations of the villagers, the fate of the Polish and Jewish villagers. The narrator recalls a ghetto in Zolochiv and its liquidation, post-war deportation of Poles, Ukrainian nationalist underground, repressions of the Soviet regime in 1939-1941 and after the war, forced collectivization.<br />

                    <p>The central concept of the research project is «social void», a phenomenon that was characteristic of Central and Eastern Europe during and immediately after World War II as a result of mass ethnic cleansing, political revolutions, forced displacement and migration.

                        <p>An interview with a native resident of the village Osivtsi of Buchach district in Ternopil oblast. The interviewee’s daughter was present during the conversation, occasionally joined it, asking additional questions to her father and expanding on what he was saying. It was obvious that the man didn’t want to give many details of what he saw and survived; he mentioned he had already “told too much.” The narrator recalled working on the farm, the Polish landlord of the village, his participation in the “Polish war”, his wife and daughters who were arrested and sent to Siberia, a school organized in their manor, which was later disassembled. The man talked about the establishment of the Soviet government in 1939 and the reaction to this of the local population. In 1942, there was a big fire in the village, and part of the houses, a Roman and a Greek Catholic church buildings burnt to ashes. The interviewee shared his memories of the Jewish villagers, their occupations and traditions, peculiar stereotypes, a ghetto in Buchach, the fate of Jews’ property and households, the stories of hiding Jews, one rescued girl who never revealed her origins even when she grew up. When asked about the Ukrainian-Polish opposition in the village, the narrator expressed his assumptions but demonstrated that he didn’t want to dig deeper into that topic. A separate conversation thread is serving in the Soviet army. He was mobilized in 1944, which he described in much detail; he returned to the village in 1948.            <br />
Recorded in Osivtsi. The interviewer – Marta Havryshko.</p>

                        <p>An interview with a native resident of the village Osivtsi, now Buchach district, whose parents died during World War II. The woman lived as an orphan together with her older brother until to her marriage. The conversation is abrupt and non-structured; the woman often complained of the now poor memory and, as a rule, just answered the interviewer’s questions. The interviewee’s granddaughter was present and occasionally joined the conversation. The narrator shared her memories of the pre-war landowner of the village, his attitude to the hired labor and fellow villagers, and the cohabitation of the Polish, Jewish and Ukrainian population of the village before the war. The woman briefly talked about the years of war in the village, the front line near it, the Ukrainian nationalist underground. She said that there was a big fire in 1942 and the village was almost burnt to ashes; people survived on the minimal help provided by the government. A separate thread initiated towards the end of the conversation was devoted to the Holocaust of Jews in Buchach. The woman recalled the names and occupations of Jews that lived in Osivtsi and the shootings of Jews in Buchach, detailing various stories, the rescue of a Jewish girl from their village by the priest in particular. Vivid were the memories of post-war life. The woman talked about religious practices in the underground, in particular, her secret marriage, the eviction of Poles, and post-war hunger.<br />

                        <p>An interview with a native resident of the village Osivtsi, now Buchach district of Ternopil oblast. The grand grandson of the interviewee was present during the conversation and complemented it with his questions and explanations. The woman recalled briefly the landlord’s manor and the work of local people, education at school, friendly relations of his family with the Polish neighbours at the background of the Ukrainian-Polish conflict in the village, Polish and Jewish village communities, their religious life, the eviction of Jews and the relocation of local Polish population to Poland, the collectivization and his own work on the collective farm, massacre of the Ukrainian underground hideout. When Osivtsi was at the front line, the interviewee’s family were hiding behind the house and entered it only to sleep and to cook; for some time, it even lived in another place. She remembers the German occupation as a time of uncertainty with the unjustified cruelty of Germans towards the local population.<br />

                        <p>A woman was born in the village Stare Selo, Pidhaitsi district in Ternopil oblast. Since 1951 she has lived in Pidhaitsi. She studied in schools of Stare Selo and Pidhaitsi and the pedagogical institute in Kremenets, then worked as a teacher. The conversation is unstructured and contains a lot of details and personalities. Describing the pre-war childhood memories, she recalled the good relationships with the Polish neighbours, going to the Roman Catholic church on Roman Catholic Christmas, Polish carols. The leitmotif of the conversation is the Holocaust in Pidhaitsi. The woman witnessed and described in detail the creation of a ghetto and the shootings of Jews. She recalls the Jewish family who lived nearby, the looting of their property after they were taken to the ghetto. The respondent described in detail several cases of Jews rescued during the German occupation and their life during Soviet times. The interview contains a lot of information about the post-war community: the creation of a collective farm and entering it, the detachments of “yastrubki” in Stare Selo. A lot was told about the teachers coming from the Eastern Regions and the attitude of the locals and the Ukrainian underground to them. Separate stories were concerned with the settlement in Pidhaitsi and the neighbourhood of Ukrainians from Poland and the starving people who came from behind the river Zbruch to ask for some food in 1946‒1947.      <br />
Recorded in Pidhaitsi. The interviewer – Marta Havryshko.</p>

                    <p>The central concept of the research project is «social void», a phenomenon that was characteristic of Central and Eastern Europe during and immediately after World War II as a result of mass ethnic cleansing, political revolutions, forced displacement and migration. The project focuses both on the material dimension of post-war social change (e.g. acquisition of property) and the subjective sphere of social practices and relationships. His goal was to examine the processes of replacing the missing elements of social life with local communities of Poland and Ukraine. The interviews conducted as part of the project show how the void was filled after the social groups (e.g. landowners, wealthy peasants), representatives of ethnic communities (Jews, Poles, Ukrainians) and professional groups (e.g. shoemakers, pharmacists, doctors, or more broadly – craftsmen, intelligence) were evicted by the war and post-war changes. The analysis concerns changes in the ownership structure, economic dysfunction, transformations of social and cultural practices, as well as changes in relations and social norms. The conversations archived at the Center were recorded in a dozen of locations in Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk and Ternopil regions by an interdisciplinary team of Polish-Ukrainian researchers. The research was carried out in small towns and villages, combining the methodology of microhistory and biographic interview as part of oral history. In total, almost 150 interviews were collected in Ukraine, of which 40 are currently available in UStories collection. The conversations recorded in Poland as part of this bilateral study are preserved in Warsaw at Archiwum Historii Mówionej. The project coordinator is Anna Wylegała, a researcher at the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Project is financed by the National Humanities Development Program, registration number 12H 13 0584 82. Galyna Bodnar worked with the materials before their publication.</p>

                        <p>An interview with a native resident of the village Halych of Berezhany (now Pidhaitsi) district in Ternopil oblast. The man was born to a large family. He told about his education at school during the German occupation, the life of the Ukrainian community before the war, Ukrainian-Polish cohabitation, a few Jewish neighbours and their occupations, the Roman Catholic church in Pidhaitsi. A separate conversation thread was the eviction of the Polish population to Poland, the fate of their property and households, the resettlement of Ukrainians in Pidhaitsi and its neighbourhoods. The man witnessed the creation of a ghetto in Pidhaitsi when he was a boy, a pupil of a school in Pidhaitsi. For the man, the memories of the Jews from Pidhaitsi are the memories of their partly preserved cemetery, as well as of the Synagogue and how it was used during the Soviet times. More detailed are the memories of post-war life: repressions of the Soviet government, forced collectivization, teachers coming to work from the Eastern regions.<br />

                        <p>An interview with the native resident of the village Perenivka, Rohatyn district. Considering the narrator's age and his excellent memory, the conversation has a vivid description of the pre-war, war and post-war life of the city Rohatyn and the neighbouring villages with numerous details and examples. The man was longing to learn and willing to escape the village: he first studied in Rohatyn school in the interwar period, then in the Soviet school between 1939 and 1941 and the German school of trade. Still, the man consciously gave up the acquired specialty and the ability to emigrate to become a local leader of the Ukrainian nationalist underground. He described in detail the opposition of the underground opposers in the second part of the 1940ies, the methods employed by the Soviet government to eliminate them, his frequent arrests and imprisonment. Born in 1922, the interviewee remembers very well the multiethnic community of Rohatyn and its neighbourhoods, the (non)cohabitation of the ethnic groups, entrance of the Soviet Army and establishment of new rules in the city, forced eviction of Polish colonists. He met the German army in Rohatyn in June of 1941 as a member of OUN and recalls the atmosphere of great expectations among the Ukrainians, the Ukrainian-Polish opposition. A separate topic covered during the interview was the Holocaust in Rohatyn – the creation and location of the ghetto in the city, the activity of the Judenrat, their hiding places that were given away. Being employed in trade in the post-war period, the interviewee had firsthand experience with the restoration of the Soviet power, took part in collectivization; he vividly describes the realia of the life of that time using the insider point of view and giving numerous examples from life.<br />

                        <p>An interview with a native resident of the village Kniahynychi, Rohatyn district, Ivano-Frankivsk oblast. The village is known as the place of active Ukrainian nationalist underground activity in the second part of the 1940ies. The father of the narrator, the member of OUN and UPA, was repressed in 1945 and died in exile. In 1947, the son, following the example of his father, became a member of the underground and remained there until 1951. To avoid eviction, the family was hiding at their relatives’ homes in various villages. The interview is full of details and names of members of the underground. The man briefly talked about the life of the village in the pre-war period, hired labor in the landlord’s household, German occupation, education at school, eviction of the Polish population, collectivization, post-war migration of the natives of the Eastern regions and Russia. A separate topic was the Jewish community of the village, a ghetto, and the shootings of Jews in Rohatyn during the German occupation. The second part of the conversation mostly has a question-answer format; the testimonies are fragmental and superficial.<br />

                        <p>An interview with a native resident of the village Rydvanivka, Rohatyn district in Ivano-Frankivsk oblast who comes from a Polish-Ukrainian family. The relatives of his mother, Polish by nationality, and father, Ukrainian, didn’t approve of the interethnic marriage. The man lost his parents as a child and was brought up by his sister. He was arrested in 1947 and returned to Rohatyn in 1954 after serving his sentence. The conversation abounds with details, names of peers and fellow villagers. The narrator tells in detail about the pre-war life of the village, rural life, aggravation of the Polish-Ukrainian opposition and forced eviction of the Poles to Poland, the restoration of the Soviet power in the post-war years and the opposition of the Ukrainian nationalist underground, help the locals provided to the rebels, Ukrainians relocated from Poland. The interviewee gives some great examples to illustrate the aggravation of the interpersonal relationships, the moments of personal choice, the unfairness of death, violence, as well as paint the portraits of the Soviet governor, a military man and a member of the Ukrainian underground. A separate conversation thread is the memories of the Holocaust of Jews in Rohatyn. The man recalled the Jewish quarter in the town, the creation and location of a ghetto, hidings, the location and the process of firing squads, the fate of the Jewish property.<br />

                    <p>The central concept of the research project is «social void», a phenomenon that was characteristic of Central and Eastern Europe during and immediately after World War II as a result of mass ethnic cleansing, political revolutions, forced displacement and migration. The project focuses both on the material dimension of post-war social change (e.g. acquisition of property) and the subjective sphere of social practices and relationships. His goal was to examine the processes of replacing the missing elements of social life with local communities of Poland and Ukraine. The interviews conducted as part of the project show how the void was filled after the social groups (e.g. landowners, wealthy peasants), representatives of ethnic communities (Jews, Poles, Ukrainians) and professional groups (e.g. shoemakers, pharmacists, doctors, or more broadly – craftsmen, intelligence) were evicted by the war and post-war changes. The analysis concerns changes in the ownership structure, economic dysfunction, transformations of social and cultural practices, as well as changes in relations and social norms. The conversations archived at the Center were recorded in a dozen of locations in Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk and Ternopil regions by an interdisciplinary team of Polish-Ukrainian researchers. The research was carried out in small towns and villages, combining the methodology of microhistory and biographic interview as part of oral history. In total, almost 150 interviews were collected in Ukraine, of which 40 are currently available in UStories collection. The conversations recorded in Poland as part of this bilateral study are preserved in Warsaw at Archiwum Historii Mówionej. The project coordinator is Anna Wylegała, a researcher at the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Project is financed by the National Humanities Development Program, registration number 12H 13 0584 82. Galyna Bodnar worked with the materials before their publication.</p>

                        <p>An interview with a native resident of the village Stratyn, Rohatyn district in Ivano Frankivsk oblast. The narrator and her parents were repressed by the Soviet government in 1944; her father died in exile in Arkhangelsk and the mother managed to escape and returned. The woman spent 17 years in exile, married another political prisoner there, and gave birth to two children. The narrator remembered a lot of Jewish neighbours of the village Stratyn and described in detail their families, places of residence, occupations and traditions. During the German occupation, all Jews in Stratyn – first, the man, and then, women and children too – were taken to the ghetto in Rohatyn and, after a certain time, shot. The woman recalled several stories about Jews hiding in the nearby villages and in Rohatyn, the fate of their property, houses and households. The narrator told about how she went to the Rohatyn ghetto to buy a shawl. The woman was a nurse in the Ukrainian nationalist underground and shared her memories of the girls taught nursing, doctors (there were Jews among them), and paramedics of the underground, the cases of providing help, her tasks in intelligence and showing the way to underground detachments. The conversation is full of names and pseudonyms of the rebels, information about the fate of some of them. A separate conversation thread is an exile in Vorkuta, the death of her father there, the limitations this posed for the children’s ability to gain education back home.<br />
Recorded in Stratyn. The interviewer – Marta Havryshko.</p>

                        <p>An interview with a native resident of the village Vorvulyntsi, Zalishchyky district of Ternopil oblast. The woman told about her family, education at school, pre-war village community, and shared her childhood memories about the Ukrainian cultural and national life of the village. During the German occupation, the woman studied in the nearby town Tovste and witnessed the Jews staying in a ghetto in the village Holovchyntsi; she recalls the stories of people hiding and giving away Jews. A large part of the interview was concerned with the restoration of the Soviet government and post-war years. The woman had to work a lot as a teenager helping her mother manage the household as her father and older brother were mobilized to the Soviet Army in 1944. The narrator went through an arrest and interrogation at the Soviet garrison prison when her family was accused of hiding participants of the Ukrainian nationalist underground. In 1952 she graduated from the pedagogical school in Chortkiv and was sent to work as a teacher at the high school of the town Tovste. The woman recalls the years of teaching, everyday life, repressions of the Soviet government and its anti-church policy, eviction of the Poles and resettlement of Ukrainians from Poland.<br />

                        <p>An interview with a native resident of the village Tovste, Zalishchyky district of Ternopil oblast. The woman graduated from accounting courses in Chortkiv and worked as a statistician in a hospital. The interviewee’s daughter was present during the interview and often joined the conversation, expanding on what her mother was saying and adding comments of her own. The interviewee often complained of her now poor memory. She told the history of her family. The father returned from work in the United States and had a large household in the village centre with a house lightning and plumbing, which was a rare thing at the time. The discussion of the pre-war life contains mainly the description of education at school, the first teacher, and fragmentary memories of the interethnic cohabitation, religious holidays of the Polish and Ukrainian population. The Soviet period of 1939 to 1941 is retained in the memory as the period of repressions and eviction of citizens to Siberia. The narrator briefly recalls everyday life during the German occupation, eviction for work, shootings of the Jews on the local cemetery, eviction of local Poles, and distribution of their property among the Ukrainians resettled from Poland. A separate conversation thread is concerned with the personal life of the woman, members of her family repressed by the Soviet government, relatives from the Ukrainian diaspora in Canada who came to visit the village. <br />

                    <p>The central concept of the research project is «social void», a phenomenon that was characteristic of Central and Eastern Europe during and immediately after World War II as a result of mass ethnic cleansing, political revolutions, forced displacement and migration. The project focuses both on the material dimension of post-war social change (e.g. acquisition of property) and the subjective sphere of social practices and relationships. His goal was to examine the processes of replacing the missing elements of social life with local communities of Poland and Ukraine. The interviews conducted as part of the project show how the void was filled after the social groups (e.g. landowners, wealthy peasants), representatives of ethnic communities (Jews, Poles, Ukrainians) and professional groups (e.g. shoemakers, pharmacists, doctors, or more broadly – craftsmen, intelligence) were evicted by the war and post-war changes. The analysis concerns changes in the ownership structure, economic dysfunction, transformations of social and cultural practices, as well as changes in relations and social norms. The conversations archived at the Center were recorded in a dozen of locations in Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk and Ternopil regions by an interdisciplinary team of Polish-Ukrainian researchers. The research was carried out in small towns and villages, combining the methodology of microhistory and biographic interview as part of oral history. In total, almost 150 interviews were collected in Ukraine, of which 40 are currently available in UStories collection. The conversations recorded in Poland as part of this bilateral study are preserved in Warsaw at Archiwum Historii Mówionej. The project coordinator is Anna Wylegała, a researcher at the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Project is financed by the National Humanities Development Program, registration number 12H 13 0584 82. Galyna Bodnar worked with the materials before their publication.</p>

                        <p>An interview with a native resident of the village Lytyachi (Letyache), now Zalishchyky district of Ternopil oblast. Keen on learning and motivated by his family, the man graduated from school in the neighbouring town Chernelytsi, studied in Buchach, in the pedagogical school in Kremenets, pedagogical institutes in Chernivtsi and Ternopil; thus, in 1949, he started teaching in Tovste and Letyache. The narration is informative, well-structured, and full of details. The narration starts with the history of the interviewee’s father who took part in the First World War and mobilization of volunteers for the Ukrainian-Polish war of 1918-1919; the father was arrested by the government but later released thanks to a chance. The man shares detailed memories of education of pupils of various nationalities at primary school in the pre-war period, interethnic cohabitation of the village community, religious life, and the changes that took place in the relationships between the fellow villagers between the 1930ies and 1940ies. The interviewee recalls in detail the Soviet government in 1939-1941 and, even more precisely, a German occupation, a ghetto, shootings of the Jews in Buchach, the activity of Ukrainian nationalist underground and the Home Army, pre-war landlord of the village and his fate. A separate conversation thread is the renovation of the Soviet power in the spring of 1944, the creation of the collective farm, teachers (local ones and those coming from the Eastern regions), everyday life, household arrangements and pastime in the post-war period.<br />

                        <p>An interview with a native and permanent resident of the town Tovste, now Zalishchyky district of Ternopil oblast. The interviewee comes from an Ukrainian-Polish family (grandfather, Polish by nationality, has come to the village during the construction of the railway and married a local Ukrainian girl), where both Polish and Ukrainian religious holidays were celebrated. Although the woman was born to an Ukrainian-Polish family, he emphasizes that she attended a Ukrainian school and Greek Catholic church. All relatives-Poles were evicted to Poland in 1946. Memories of the pre-war and war years are faint. Fragmentary are the memories of teachers in times of the first Soviet government and German occupation, older Jewish and Polish population, a street in Tovste where the Jews lived, Germans shooting Jews on the village cemetery, a Jewish woman rescued by the Polish one, the bombing of the railway and the destroyal of part of the town during the war. The woman names Ukrainian neighbours-friends; the only Polish girl she was friends with moved to Poland. The woman doesn’t recall any Jewish friends. The focus of the interview is shifted towards the post-war life of the narrator at the end of 1940ies and 1950ies: financial situation, mother’s work in the collective farm and not wishing such fate for her daughter, working in the financial department of the district, repressions and evictions, the practices of writing the “correct Curriculum Vitae”, everyday life, social sphere, medicine. The narrator tells in detail about the Soviet anti-religious policy in the 1950ies and religious practices in the underground, her secret marriage in 1951, and the baptism of the children in particular. A leitmotif recurring in the conversation in the pain from loss of her father, repressed in 1941 during the retreat of the Soviet government, and thus the regret over the inability to study as she wished to because of the need to help her single mother and permanent financial hardship.<br />

                        <p>An interview with a native resident of the village Tataryntsi, now Lanivtsi district of Ternopil oblast. The narrator moved to Tovste in 1952 to work as a nurse; this is why she started the conversation by sharing her insights into the status and perspectives of Soviet medicine in the town during the Soviet times. The woman described in detail her childhood memories of pre-war life of the village Tataryntsi located on the Polish-Soviet border. Even more detailed were the memories of the German occupation, which she remembers as Germans’ burning the villages and sending people to work in Germany. She found out about the Holocaust when she was a student and took part in the process of clearing the destroyed houses of a former ghetto in Kremenets. The interview provides information about education at the medical and obstetric school in Kremenets, the adaptation of the girl in a Galician town among people who considered her to be a “Komsomol girl.” Much attention is devoted to the post-war arrangements and everyday life, working in the hospital, medical and nursing staff, dual nature of the religious life in the Soviet times.<br />
Recorded in Tovste. The interviewer – Natalia Otrishchenko.</p>

                    <p>The central concept of the research project is «social void», a phenomenon that was characteristic of Central and Eastern Europe during and immediately after World War II as a result of mass ethnic cleansing, political revolutions, forced displacement and migration. The project focuses both on the material dimension of post-war social change (e.g. acquisition of property) and the subjective sphere of social practices and relationships. His goal was to examine the processes of replacing the missing elements of social life with local communities of Poland and Ukraine. The interviews conducted as part of the project show how the void was filled after the social groups (e.g. landowners, wealthy peasants), representatives of ethnic communities (Jews, Poles, Ukrainians) and professional groups (e.g. shoemakers, pharmacists, doctors, or more broadly – craftsmen, intelligence) were evicted by the war and post-war changes. The analysis concerns changes in the ownership structure, economic dysfunction, transformations of social and cultural practices, as well as changes in relations and social norms. The conversations archived at the Center were recorded in a dozen of locations in Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk and Ternopil regions by an interdisciplinary team of Polish-Ukrainian researchers. The research was carried out in small towns and villages, combining the methodology of microhistory and biographic interview as part of oral history. In total, almost 150 interviews were collected in Ukraine, of which 40 are currently available in UStories collection. The conversations recorded in Poland as part of this bilateral study are preserved in Warsaw at Archiwum Historii Mówionej. The project coordinator is Anna Wylegała, a researcher at the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Project is financed by the National Humanities Development Program, registration number 12H 13 0584 82. Galyna Bodnar worked with the materials before their publication.</p>

                        <p>An interview with a woman born in the village Ushnya, Olesko, now Zolochiv district of Lviv oblast. The woman was born to the Ukrainian-Polish family; she told about the pre-war village community, numerous Polish and several Jewish families, their peaceful interethnic cohabitation. The interviewee tells briefly about education at school, the establishment of the Soviet government in 1939 and shootings of prisoners in Zolochiv before the departure, German occupation and hiding not to be taken to work in Germany (a relative arranged for work in Lviv for the interviewee to avoid the eviction), induced help to the Ukrainian underground, eviction of the Polish villagers to Poland, forced collectivization, post-war repressions of the Soviet government. The narrator had a Jewish classmate, made friends with her and stayed at her home. This Jewish girl was hiding in the woods near the village for a year, but their hiding place was exposed, and they were shot. The woman recalls what happened to the abandoned property, lands and households of the Jewish, Polish and evicted population. A separate conversation thread is devoted to Ukrainians resettled from Poland as the interviewee married one in 1946.<br />
Recorded in Zolochiv. The interviewer – Marta Havryshko.</p>

                        <p>An interview with a native and permanent resident of the village Barysh, now Buchach district of Ternopil oblast. The interviewee’s daughter was present and constantly joined the conversation, rephrasing the questions, expanding on what her mother told, and adding comments of her own. Because of the age, the narrator often complained of the already poor memory. The interview started with the detailed history of the interviewee’s family. The woman also told about the family of Jews who lived nearby, their occupations, their children going to school together with her daughter. During the occupation, she was hiding the head of this family for some time (she started to live in his house since then). The narrator witnessed the shooting of a group of Jews who were hiding in the woods; they were escorted near her house. A separate conversation thread is the massacre of local Poles by Ukrainian nationalist underground, their burial in the cemetery, hiding the saved Poles in the houses of Ukrainian villagers, aggravated mutual hostility. The woman also recalled the Polish landowner, owner of the manor, who was repressed by the Soviet government and whose property was first taken by the local population and then used for the collective farm needs. Towards the end of the war, Ukrainians resettled from Poland inhabited the houses of the deceased and evicted Poles. The woman tells about the arrangements they made, their relationships with the local population, as well as about the post-war life of the village as such.<br />
Recorded in Barash. The interviewer – Marta Havryshko.   </p>

                        <p>An interview with a native and permanent resident of the village Barysh, now Buchach district of Ternopil oblast. The woman complains of her poor memory on many occasions, and some interview questions remained not answered. The conversation started with the detailed description of the history of the narrator’s family, whose mother, after becoming a widow, married an older local Pole, whose family was later evicted to Poland. The woman mentions that interethnic marriages were common for their village. She tells about the Polish lord (didych) of the village, his manor and household, the fate of the owner and his property. The woman tells in detail about the Jews of Barash: their places of residence, occupations, certain personal data, religious life, the attitude of the villagers, stereotypes. Not being a witness to the events, the woman only briefly retells the story of shootings of Jews in Buchach and Barysh. A separate conversation thread is the second arrival of the Soviet government, collectivization, religious life in the underground, eviction of Poles to Poland, post-war arrests and repressions. The woman witnessed a massacre of Poles by the Ukrainian nationalist underground in Barysh in February of 1945, which she vividly describes using the example of the killed family Ukrainians made part of. <br />

                        <p>An interview with a native and permanent resident of the village Bezbrody in Busk district of Lviv oblast. The daughter of the interviewee was present and occasionally interfered with the conversation giving her comments. A separate narrative was concerned with the childhood memories about World War II and post-war repressions of the Soviet government. She briefly mentions The Polish landowner, his household and family, their fate during the war. The woman comes from a mixed Ukrainian-Polish family and uses the example of her family to tell about the religious life of the village community in the pre-war and war years. As a young girl, the woman made friends with the neighbouring Jewish girls; she told about the traditions of Jews, their occupations, the fates of some of the Jewish villagers. The woman told about the difficult life after the war because of the opposition of Ukrainian nationalist underground and the Soviet government, as well as everyday life: collectivization, family life, children, work, managing the household, medicine, earnings, trade. <br />
Recorded in Bezbrody. The interviewer – Natalia Otrishchenko.</p>

                        <p>An interview with a native and permanent resident of the town Bibrka, now Peremyshlyany district. The interviewee’s daughter was present during the interview and sometimes joined the conversation: rephrased the questions and occasionally complemented what her mother was saying. Childhood memories didn’t contain all the aspects of the pre-war history of the town, compared to, for example, smaller village communities members’ memories. The family of the narrator has a small shop in the house where they lived. Later, their house was neighbouring a ghetto in Bibrka; this is why the woman witnessed its creation, Jews staying there, starvation and attempts to get some food, hidings, and firing squads. The narrator tells in detail about the Jewish neighbours: places of residence, occupation, religious life, stereotypes. Regarding the pre-war life of the village, the woman recalled education at school, teachers and interethnic cohabitation of the village community. More detailed recollections about the german occupation contained details of the cantonment, eviction of the youth for works in Germany, education at school, teachers.<br />

                    <p>The central concept of the research project is «social void», a phenomenon that was characteristic of Central and Eastern Europe during and immediately after World War II as a result of mass ethnic cleansing, political revolutions, forced displacement and migration. The project focuses both on the material dimension of post-war social change (e.g. acquisition of property) and the subjective sphere of social practices and relationships. His goal was to examine the processes of replacing the missing elements of social life with local communities of Poland and Ukraine. The interviews conducted as part of the project show how the void was filled after the social groups (e.g. landowners, wealthy peasants), representatives of ethnic communities (Jews, Poles, Ukrainians) and professional groups (e.g. shoemakers, pharmacists, doctors, or more broadly – craftsmen, intelligence) were evicted by the war and post-war changes. The analysis concerns changes in the ownership structure, economic dysfunction, transformations of social and cultural practices, as well as changes in relations and social norms. The conversations archived at the Center were recorded in a dozen of locations in Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk and Ternopil regions by an interdisciplinary team of Polish-Ukrainian researchers. The research was carried out in small towns and villages, combining the methodology of microhistory and biographic interview as part of oral history. In total, almost 150 interviews were collected in Ukraine, of which 40 are currently available in UStories collection. The conversations recorded in Poland as part of this bilateral study are preserved in Warsaw at Archiwum Historii Mówionej. The project coordinator is Anna Wylegała, a researcher at the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Project is financed by the National Humanities Development Program, registration number 12H 13 0584 82. Galyna Bodnar worked with the materials before their publication.</p>

                        <p>An interview with the native and permanent resident of the town  Bibrka, now Peremyshlyany district of Lviv oblast. The woman was born to a multiethnic family of Ukrainians, Poles and Germans - her mother was Polish and grandmother was German. To avoid difficult work in agriculture, the narrator set a goal to gain an education, which she attained in 1953, graduating from the Faculty of Biology of Ivan Franko National University of Lviv. A bright childhood memory is the creation of a ghetto in the centre of Bibrka and shootings of Jews near a neighbouring village Strilky. As an eight-year-old girl, the narrator saw the dead bodies of shot Jews in the not yet buried common grave. The interviewee tells about where the Jews lived in Bibrka, their shops in the town’s centre, Jewish neighbours, what they did and how they helped her parents out by supplying products during the war. The woman also recalls her education in the Polish school and her Polish teachers. A separate conversation thread is the aggravation of the Ukrainian-Polish conflict during the war, mutual help in hiding the families of Ukrainians and Poles, repressions of the Soviet government. She told the story she heard from her relatives about the retreat of the Soviet government in June of 1941 and people murdered in prison. The more detailed recollections about life in the village after the war contained the description of the eviction of Poles to Poland, resettled from the East of Ukraine teachers, education and working at school during the Soviet times.<br />

                        <p>An interview with a man born in the village Mali Lanky, which is near the town Birky, now Peremyshlyany district of Lviv oblast. The interviewee’s daughter was present from time to time but almost did not interfere in the conversation. Childhood memories are concerned with the family and education at the local school and school in Bibrka, where children of Polish, Ukrainian and Jewish families studied together. The narrator tells about the Jewish families in the village, their places of residence and occupation. He also tells fragmentally about individual Jews in Bibrka – their last names, occupation, professional reputation, and about the pre-war interethnic cohabitation of the village community, Polish landowners and their manors. Considering the respondent’s age, he described in much detail the establishment of the Soviet government in the region in 1939, the repressions of Polish colonists and local landowners, killing of prisoners of the Soviet regime during its retreat from Bibrka at the end of June 1941. A separate conversation thread was the creation of a ghetto in Bibrka, shootings of Jews and the fate of their property, local German administration, sending young people to work in Germany, the creation of the SS Division “Galicia”, and the interviewee’s work in Lviv during the German occupation.<br />

                        <p>An interview with a native and permanent resident of the town Bibrka, now Peremyshlyany district of Lviv oblast. The publicity of the narrator who was invited to share his memories in several other research projects already was perceived during the interview. A man was born to a Ukrainian-Polish family (his mother was Polish). He told about his education at school in Bibrka in the pre-war period, where Polish, Ukrainian and Jewish children studied together. The conversation was also concerned with the pre-war daily lives of the multinational town citizens. The narrator recalls Jewish families on his street and in the town in general: their names and surnames, places of residence, occupation, as well as the establishment of the Soviet government in Bibrka and the repressions against Polish governors and entrepreneurs, the massacre of Jews in the town’s centre after the retreat of the Soviet government in June 1941. The interviewee demarcated the margins of the ghetto in the town, described how the Jews lived there, their fate and the fate of their property, told the story of one rescued teenager and one of his saviors. The man recalls very well a lot of Polish citizens evicted to Poland after the war; he named their names and occupation.  <br />

                        <p>An interview with a native and permanent resident of the village Dobropole, now Buchach district of Ternopil oblast. The narrator was born to a Ukrainian-Polish family and recalls how he and his mother went to the Roman Catholic Cathedral in their village. After recalling some childhood memories, the narrator tells about education at school, where children of the local Polish, Ukrainian and Jewish citizens studied together. The man remembers very well the establishment of the Soviet government in 1939, repressed Polish colonists, everyday life of German occupation, the local government, a religious life, certain households and their fates, the aggravation of Polish-Ukrainian opposition during the war, and post-war Soviet repressions. The interviewee tells about the Jewish families in the village: their occupations, places of residence, the fate of their property. A separate conversation thread is the Holocaust in Buchach. The man retold the story of one rescued teenager, his peer, who hid in the neighbouring village, and the family in Dobropole who helped him and another boy. Another Jewish family was rescued by the Polish family, who managed to escape the Soviet repressions of 1940.<br />
Recorded in Dobropole. The interviewer – Marta Havryshko.</p>

                    <p>The central concept of the research project is «social void», a phenomenon that was characteristic of Central and Eastern Europe during and immediately after World War II as a result of mass ethnic cleansing, political revolutions, forced displacement and migration. The project focuses both on the material dimension of post-war social change (e.g. acquisition of property) and the subjective sphere of social practices and relationships. His goal was to examine the processes of replacing the missing elements of social life with local communities of Poland and Ukraine. The interviews conducted as part of the project show how the void was filled after the social groups (e.g. landowners, wealthy peasants), representatives of ethnic communities (Jews, Poles, Ukrainians) and professional groups (e.g. shoemakers, pharmacists, doctors, or more broadly – craftsmen, intelligence) were evicted by the war and post-war changes. The analysis concerns changes in the ownership structure, economic dysfunction, transformations of social and cultural practices, as well as changes in relations and social norms. The conversations archived at the Center were recorded in a dozen of locations in Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk and Ternopil regions by an interdisciplinary team of Polish-Ukrainian researchers. The research was carried out in small towns and villages, combining the methodology of microhistory and biographic interview as part of oral history. In total, almost 150 interviews were collected in Ukraine, of which 40 are currently available in UStories collection. The conversations recorded in Poland as part of this bilateral study are preserved in Warsaw at Archiwum Historii Mówionej. The project coordinator is Anna Wylegała, a researcher at the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Project is financed by the National Humanities Development Program, registration number 12H 13 0584 82. Galyna Bodnar worked with the materials before their publication.</p>

                        <p>A conversation with the woman who was born and has lived in the village Hlibiv in Husiatyn district of Ternopil oblast is well-structured: the respondent mostly just answered the questions of the interviewer. After the fragmentary childhood memories about a Jewish village teacher, the woman shared a more detailed story about several Jewish families in the village, their place of residence, occupation, and fate during the occupation. The woman recalled a Polish landowner, his manor and escaping abroad, the paid labor on the folwark. A separate conversation thread is the Ukrainian-Polish opposition and mutual massacres during the war, the restoration of the Soviet power and post-war repressions. Numerous Polish villagers were evicted to Poland, and resettled Ukrainians came to live in the village in the post-war period.<br />

                        <p>An interview with a woman born in the village Hlibiv in Husiatyn district, Ternopil oblast. The conversation started with a detailed description of the narrator’s family: the fate of her father, an owner of a cafe in the village Skalat who after the arrival of the Red army joined a Ukrainian nationalist underground, repressions, hidings, mother and children coming out of the underground, the unknown fate of the father, the attitude of the post-war village community to the family of the underground opposer. Another memory was also concerned with the Ukrainian-Polish opposition during the war and bloody massacres that crashed into a child's memory. She also told briefly about the Polish landowner in the village, shootings of the Jews in Skalat, the establishment of the Soviet government, and putting an end to the Ukrainian underground and anyone concerned with it. More detailed were the memories of the post-war village life: everyday life, education and teachers, heads of the collective farms, the fates of individual insurgents.<br />

                        <p>An interview with a native and permanent resident of the village Hlibiv, now Husiatyn district of Ternopil oblast. The granddaughter of the woman was present during the interview, expanded on what was being told, and added her own questions. The conversation is unstructured and contains a lot of personalities in the interviewer’s questions. The interviewee often complains of her now poor memory. The woman told about her childhood, education at school and teachers of the pre-war period, Polish landowner who employed impoverished villagers. She told in detail about the Jewish family of the cloth merchant, who owned a shop in a village. Soon before the arrival of the German troops, this and other Jewish families were evicted and their property was looted by the villagers. The narrator comes from an Ukrainian-Polish family; her father, Ukrainian, insisted on her baptism in a Greek Catholic church. The woman remembers domestic interethnic conflicts of the villagers and their aggravation during the war, repressions of the Soviet government and deportation of the Polish population to Poland. The woman married a Ukrainian who resettled from Poland and shares the memories of the post-war life of resettled families. A separate conversation thread is the activity of the Ukrainian nationalist underground in the village, the support they got from the locals, killings of teachers who came from the East of Ukraine, repressions of the Soviet government.<br />

                        <p>An interview with a native and permanent resident of the village Koropets, now Monastyryskyi district of Ternopil oblast. A man was a small boy in times of war but told a lot of stories he heard from his mother and relatives. The interview is full of details about post-war Soviet life and information about the history of the man’s village and its neighbourhoods. The narrator’s daughter was present towards the end of the interview and occasionally clarified her father. The man comes from a family of Ukrainians but used the example of his close relatives to illustrate the difficult cohabitation of the Ukrainians and the Polish before the war, frequent interethnic marriages, deportation to Poland. He spoke about a manor and a household in the village, hired labor, the fate of the landowner and his family, aggravation of a Ukrainian-Polish conflict during the war. A separate conversation thread is a ghetto in Koropets and the fate of the local Jews and their property, firing squads, stories of individual rescued Jews. The memories of the post-war Soviet life of the village are more extensive: the man recalls the relocation of Ukrainians from Poland, the arrangements at a school, the teachers coming from the Easters regions, Ukrainian nationalist underground.<br />
Recorded in Koropets. The interviewer – Anna Wylegała.</p>

                    <p>The central concept of the research project is «social void», a phenomenon that was characteristic of Central and Eastern Europe during and immediately after World War II as a result of mass ethnic cleansing, political revolutions, forced displacement and migration. The project focuses both on the material dimension of post-war social change (e.g. acquisition of property) and the subjective sphere of social practices and relationships. His goal was to examine the processes of replacing the missing elements of social life with local communities of Poland and Ukraine. The interviews conducted as part of the project show how the void was filled after the social groups (e.g. landowners, wealthy peasants), representatives of ethnic communities (Jews, Poles, Ukrainians) and professional groups (e.g. shoemakers, pharmacists, doctors, or more broadly – craftsmen, intelligence) were evicted by the war and post-war changes. The analysis concerns changes in the ownership structure, economic dysfunction, transformations of social and cultural practices, as well as changes in relations and social norms. The conversations archived at the Center were recorded in a dozen of locations in Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk and Ternopil regions by an interdisciplinary team of Polish-Ukrainian researchers. The research was carried out in small towns and villages, combining the methodology of microhistory and biographic interview as part of oral history. In total, almost 150 interviews were collected in Ukraine, of which 40 are currently available in UStories collection. The conversations recorded in Poland as part of this bilateral study are preserved in Warsaw at Archiwum Historii Mówionej. The project coordinator is Anna Wylegała, a researcher at the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

                        <p>An interview with a native and permanent resident of the village Koropets, now Monastyryskyi district of Ternopil oblast. A woman was born to a Ukrainian-Polish family and was baptized in a Roman Catholic Church. In times of war, the woman studied outside of the village, which is why she knew little of the life of her village during the German occupation. She started her narration by describing the charms of the manor before war: its garden and interior of the palace, the family of a landlord and its life, the work of local villagers in the household. The woman shared her childhood memories about religious traditions and the coexistence of various nations that made up a village community. She spoke about numerous classmates-Jews, their families, occupations, places of residence, as well as Jewing buildings in the village, their fate after the war, a synagogue in particular. A separate conversation thread is the forced deportation of local Jews into a ghetto in Buchach and further shootings of those who remained or managed to return to the village centre. The woman tells in detail about the deportation of the Polish villagers to Poland in the post-war years: the motifs, the circumstances of departure, the fate of the abandoned property. Towards the end of the interview, the focus shifts towards the post-war life of the interviewee: financial situation, work, everyday life, social sphere, and medicine. The woman also emphasized the aggravation of a Ukrainian-Polish opposition during the war, the burning of the neighboring village Puzhnyky in 1945, the repressions of the Soviet government, the teachers coming from the East of Ukraine.<br />

                        <p>An interview with a native and permanent resident of the village Koropets, now Monastyryskyi district of Ternopil oblast. He is interested in local history and has his publication, which he reads during the interview. The man started the conversation by telling the history of his family, his father’s work on the hop production in the local landlord in particular. He mentioned shortly the family of the landlord and his fate, pre-war interethnic and religious life of the local community, and education at school. The man witnessed the entrance of the Red army into the village in 1939, the escape of the landlord and looting in his manor, arrests and repressions. He describes in detail the retreat of the Soviet power and the entrance of the German army in the summer of 1941. A separate conversation thread was devoted to the pre-war cohabitation with the Jews, their occupation and places of residence, the Holocaust in Koropets, the Ukrainian auxiliary police, the fate of the Jews’ property. The leitmotif of the conversation was the history of the interviewee’s brother, the participant of the Ukrainian nationalist underground, who emigrated to the West in 1944, and the interviewee’s help to the underground and his arrest in 1953. The narrator tells about numerous underground opposers repressed by the Soviet government, their names and the terms of imprisonment, as well as about the massacres organized by the Ukrainian underground. He mentions the aggravation of a Ukrainian-Polish armed conflict during the war and the burning of the neighboring village Puzhnyky by the Ukrainian underground. Towards the end of the war, the houses of the exiled Polish people were occupied by the Ukrainians coming from Poland; the man tells about their arrangements, half-starving existence, and relationships with the local population, as well as the everyday life of the village citizens after the war.<br />

                        <p>An interview with a native and permanent resident of the village Kuriany, now Berezhany district of Ternopil district. The conversation is abrupt and unstructured and the answers are somewhat fragmentary; the interviewee mostly just answered the questions of the interviewer. A woman was born to a Ukrainian-Polish family (her mother was Polish). From the pre-war period, the woman recalled education at school and teachers; she also vaguely recalled interethnic cohabitation. She told about the village lord (didych) and his family, attitude to the villagers, and the religious life. The narrator recalled the names and occupations of Jews who lived in Kuriany, their exile to the ghetto created in Berezhany, and shootings. The small number of Polish villagers were still the reason for the aggravation of the Ukrainian-Polish opposition during the war. In the interview, the participants to the conflict from both parties, the deceased, as well as those collaborating with the German and Soviet government, are personified. The woman tells about the post-war eviction of Polish villagers and the coming of Ukrainians from Poland, including how they arranged their lives and formed relationships with the local population. The memories about teachers coming from Eastern Ukraine and the attitude of the locals and the Ukrainian underground to them are fragmentary.<br />

                        <p>An interview with a native and permanent resident of the village Lany of Peremyshlyany district, Lviv oblast. The conversation started with the memories of the family and the pre-war life of the village; it was mainly concerned with the description of the education at school and teachers, the interethnic (non)cohabitation of the villagers, manor of the local Polish landowner and the fate of his household during the war and in times of the Soviet government. A separate conversation thread is the pre-war Jewish villagers, their occupations and places of residence, traditions, stereotypes, hiding during the war, and sporadic help of the locals. When a teenager, the woman studied at school in Bibrka and thus recalls the ghetto and shootings of Jews in the town. A right childhood memory is the Ukrainian-Polish opposition during the war; the woman recalls local cases of massacres, eviction of the Polish population to Poland, and resettlement of Ukrainian migrants. She recalled in more detail the post-war life of the village: education and teachers, everyday and religious life.<br />

                        <p>An interview with a native and permanent resident of the village Utikhovychi of Peremyshlyany district, Lviv oblast. The woman comes from a German family, whose father was taken for a Polish. Thus, the woman started the conversation by telling about how her father was hiding from the Ukrainian nationalist underground and the Soviet government after the end of the war. The landlord of the village was a Jew who managed to survive during the Holocaust and emigrated; his family was shot in the nearby woods. The narrator also tells the story of the Jewish girl who was hiding in one of the village families during the war. She recalls abruptly the family of the Jew landowner, her father’s hired labor, and robbery of the farm. Considering the woman’s age, the conversation was mainly concerned with the end of the war and the post-war years under the Soviet government, the opposition of the Ukrainian nationalist underground, repressions of the government and the massacres organized by the underground in the village, collectivization, and eviction of the Polish population. The interview contains lots of personalities and details of separate stories.<br />
Recorded in Utikhovychi. The interviewer – Marta Havryshko.</p>

                    <p>The central concept of the research project is «social void», a phenomenon that was characteristic of Central and Eastern Europe during and immediately after World War II as a result of mass ethnic cleansing, political revolutions, forced displacement and migration. The project focuses both on the material dimension of post-war social change (e.g. acquisition of property) and the subjective sphere of social practices and relationships. His goal was to examine the processes of replacing the missing elements of social life with local communities of Poland and Ukraine. The interviews conducted as part of the project show how the void was filled after the social groups (e.g. landowners, wealthy peasants), representatives of ethnic communities (Jews, Poles, Ukrainians) and professional groups (e.g. shoemakers, pharmacists, doctors, or more broadly – craftsmen, intelligence) were evicted by the war and post-war changes. The analysis concerns changes in the ownership structure, economic dysfunction, transformations of social and cultural practices, as well as changes in relations and social norms. The conversations archived at the Center were recorded in a dozen of locations in Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk and Ternopil regions by an interdisciplinary team of Polish-Ukrainian researchers. The research was carried out in small towns and villages, combining the methodology of microhistory and biographic interview as part of oral history. In total, almost 150 interviews were collected in Ukraine, of which 40 are currently available in UStories collection. The conversations recorded in Poland as part of this bilateral study are preserved in Warsaw at Archiwum Historii Mówionej.

                        <p>An interview with a native resident of the village Kuriany, now Berezhany district in Ternopil oblast. After telling a short story about her family, the interviewee shared her tragedy – her father, the head of the collective farm, was killed by the Ukrainian nationalist underground in 1947 – and, as a continuation of it, the series of murders of Ukrainians and Poles in the village. The woman recalled the family of the Polish landlord, repressed by the Soviet government in 1939. She briefly described his manor and household, hired labor of the villagers and her father in particular, attitude to the villagers. Describing the pre-war life, the narrator told about several Jewish families and their occupations and the fate of the abandoned property and retold the story of the ghetto in Berezhany and the shootings of Jews, which she heard from her father. The woman devotes specific attention to several villagers in Kuriany (Polish and Ukrainian) who fell victims to the Soviet regime and Ukrainian nationalist underground.<br />

                        <p>An interview with a native resident of the village Koropets, Monastyrysk district in Ternopil oblast. Childhood memories contain many stories about the landowner Badeni, his manor, household, hired labor, as well as the fate of the host and his manor after 1939. A harmful trauma for the woman was the eviction of her grandfather to Siberia in 1941, which she witnessed. The narrator and other children from the village who were often curious about what was going on witnessed the shootings of Jews but did not want to talk much about it. The woman drew a detailed mental map of the town with the Jewish shrine, a bakery, a reading room, and other buildings significant for the residents of the town. Fragmentary were the memories of the Ukrainian-Polish opposition, the burning of the neighbouring village Puzhnyky, and the deportation of the Poles to Poland.<br />

                        <p>An interview with a woman born in Lviv who is a permanent resident of the village Hlibiv, Husiatyn district of Ternopil oblast. The conversation started with the detailed description of the narrator’s family and childhood years. She faced the war in September 1939 in Lviv and shared her childhood memories of the event. Her parents were a hired labor force in the city. Considering the financial hardship, the family soon moved to the father’s home village, Hlibiv. After the brief account of the German occupation, the woman talked about the post-war hardship, family life, the unbearable taxation of the villagers, hard work on the collective farm, and the fear that was characteristic of life in the Stalin times. Responding to the questionnaire part of the interview, the woman told about her father-in-law who was in charge of the village during German occupation and his arrest and exile to Siberia after the war; the post-war life of the village. Retelling the stories of the locals, the woman shared information about the Polish landlord, his escape from the Red Army and looting of the manor. A separate conversation thread is the Holocaust in Hlibiv and its neighbourhoods. The woman recalls the starvation of 1946 and 1947 and people coming from behind Zbruch in search of food. Fragmentary were the accounts of the Ukrainians resettled from Poland, the eviction of Poles after the war, and fellow villagers who emigrated to Canada.      <br />
Recorded in Hlibiv. The interviewer – Wiktoria Kudela-Świątek.</p>
