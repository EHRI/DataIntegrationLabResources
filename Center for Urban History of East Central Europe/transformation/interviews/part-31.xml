                    <p>The central concept of the research project is «social void», a phenomenon that was characteristic of Central and Eastern Europe during and immediately after World War II as a result of mass ethnic cleansing, political revolutions, forced displacement and migration. The project focuses both on the material dimension of post-war social change (e.g. acquisition of property) and the subjective sphere of social practices and relationships. His goal was to examine the processes of replacing the missing elements of social life with local communities of Poland and Ukraine. The interviews conducted as part of the project show how the void was filled after the social groups (e.g. landowners, wealthy peasants), representatives of ethnic communities (Jews, Poles, Ukrainians) and professional groups (e.g. shoemakers, pharmacists, doctors, or more broadly – craftsmen, intelligence) were evicted by the war and post-war changes. The analysis concerns changes in the ownership structure, economic dysfunction, transformations of social and cultural practices, as well as changes in relations and social norms. The conversations archived at the Center were recorded in a dozen of locations in Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk and Ternopil regions by an interdisciplinary team of Polish-Ukrainian researchers. The research was carried out in small towns and villages, combining the methodology of microhistory and biographic interview as part of oral history. In total, almost 150 interviews were collected in Ukraine, of which 40 are currently available in UStories collection. The conversations recorded in Poland as part of this bilateral study are preserved in Warsaw at Archiwum Historii Mówionej. The project coordinator is Anna Wylegała, a researcher at the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Project is financed by the National Humanities Development Program, registration number 12H 13 0584 82. Galyna Bodnar worked with the materials before their publication.</p>

                        <p>An interview with the native resident of the village Perenivka, Rohatyn district. Considering the narrator's age and his excellent memory, the conversation has a vivid description of the pre-war, war and post-war life of the city Rohatyn and the neighbouring villages with numerous details and examples. The man was longing to learn and willing to escape the village: he first studied in Rohatyn school in the interwar period, then in the Soviet school between 1939 and 1941 and the German school of trade. Still, the man consciously gave up the acquired specialty and the ability to emigrate to become a local leader of the Ukrainian nationalist underground. He described in detail the opposition of the underground opposers in the second part of the 1940ies, the methods employed by the Soviet government to eliminate them, his frequent arrests and imprisonment. Born in 1922, the interviewee remembers very well the multiethnic community of Rohatyn and its neighbourhoods, the (non)cohabitation of the ethnic groups, entrance of the Soviet Army and establishment of new rules in the city, forced eviction of Polish colonists. He met the German army in Rohatyn in June of 1941 as a member of OUN and recalls the atmosphere of great expectations among the Ukrainians, the Ukrainian-Polish opposition. A separate topic covered during the interview was the Holocaust in Rohatyn – the creation and location of the ghetto in the city, the activity of the Judenrat, their hiding places that were given away. Being employed in trade in the post-war period, the interviewee had firsthand experience with the restoration of the Soviet power, took part in collectivization; he vividly describes the realia of the life of that time using the insider point of view and giving numerous examples from life.<br />
Recorded in Rohatyn. The interviewer – Anna Chebotariova. </p>
