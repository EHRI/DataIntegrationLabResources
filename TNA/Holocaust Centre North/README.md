:construction: This page is under construction!

This is the first test integration made for the Holocaust Centre North using TNA's Discovery API.

1. Create a URLset dataset with the targeted collections as in the example HCN_urlset.tsv using the HTTP header "Accept: application/xml"
2. Add the discovery2ead.tsv transformation file.
3. Convert the files and ingest them without a specific properties file.
